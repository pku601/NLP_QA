Q2911	Fire safety legislation in Qatar daycares Hi folks,  I am going to inspect my son's daycare tomorrow in regards to fire safety practices that are (or are not) employed on site. I want to know what the law states as what are minimum requirements, such as a sprinkler system, fire drills and fire exits.  I have had a look through MOI and defense websites, but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. Any advice on this would be much appreciated.  Cheers,  KIQ
Q2911_C1	I think many parents may be I think many parents may be doing this in the coming weeks kiwi....the authorities need to take a good hard look at themselves and the slack practices currently in place...but for now the time is for grieving and mourning.
Q2911_C2	excuse me for being naive excuse me for being naive Mandi,  but are u serious or joking? i mean, no kidding, i don't want to end up showered in powder or water, with alarm going on and fire brigade comming over. can i do like u said or ur joking?
Q2911_C3	This is best done by a This is best done by a certification agency, with people holding expertise in the subject. The MoI need to qualify a list of such agencies and pay them generously to establish branches here in Qatar.  Permission renewal cannot be issued without such certificate on annual basis.
Q2911_C4	No joke drsam, that is a test No joke drsam, that is a test button in the smoke alarm.  Do not touch the sprinklers if you have them.
Q2911_C5	No, it's not a joke, habibi! No, it's not a joke, habibi! If you are talking about the kitchen in your house you just have a self-contained smoke detector, not a sprinkler system. A white plastic round object? There is a test button. There may also be a little green light.  If you have a nozzle leading to a pipe that might be a sprinkler system. Sprinkler systems are heat-activated, not smoke sensitive. So don't worry about pushing a button on a white plastic box. It's not hard-wired into the emergency response system. It's just there to wake you up and get you out of the house in case of smoke. Mandi
Q2911_C6	translator, thks; the translator and mandi, thks; the "ear-splitting shriek" will turn off automatically after a minute or two, or do i have to turn it off somehow?
Q2911_C7	In most buildings these are In most buildings these are not smoke detectors (smoke being the primary cause of death in fire situations) they are heat detectors and are therefore mostly useless.  Most people I know who are interested/cognizant of real fire safety have brought smoke detectors from their home countries and installed them in their homes/flats.  Heat detectors are of little to no use - especially if you are asleep when the fire starts.  Smoke detectors are easy to test, just burn a piece of toast in the same or nearby room.  The smoke will set it off.
Q2911_C8	drsam and others--it's easy drsam and others--it's easy enough to buy your own, if you are unsure of the ones provided.  Change the batteries every year.  When we moved to Qatar I bought a simple battery one for each room--worth every penny.
Q2911_C9	drsam:it depends also on drsam:it depends also on whether it is stand alone smoke detector or it is connected through wires to main fire panel which is normally located centrally in building entrance or guard house. Wired type smoke detectors r normally tested using smoke spray (Brand name:Solo etc). Installation of fire alarm system requires routine preventive maintenance and calibration of detection devices; usually done by qualified technicians.
Q2911_C10	heat detectors heat detectors are used in areas prone to dust or smoke in normal condition like kitchen, ware houses, washrooms(due to exhaust fan), parking floors etc, smoke detector in this situation leads to more false alarms
Q2911_C11	maintenance for Ac's Please also do periodic maintenance for AC;specially during the hot season, the compressor withdraws extra current to so as to reach the cooling setpoint; this results extra current flowing than normal & eventually spark.
Q2911_C12	So does anyone have info on So does anyone have info on fire-safety laws relating to childcare facilities in Qatar?  Some good points here though. Raven, I agree, now is the time is for grieving and mourning. However, I still have to drop my toddler off tomorrow at a daycare that may or may not be unsafe. My kids are my first priority and I will do what I have to do as soon as I can, not in the coming weeks. Drsam. Don't be scared of your smoke alarm. It won't bite.......very hard. Good point about the A/C Aijaz, our electricity is dodgy anyway. Lights blow out every day, come on and off on their own accord.
Q2911_C13	alarms for sprinkler systems, I would suggest a joint drill by the house owners and the occupants, and in the case of a school or day care center, it is best decided with cooperation between the parents and the school authorities.   The test is simple, a hydrotest is all that is required to check the pressure and the coverage area of each sprinkler.  Refer to this link for your understanding, (note: this is not reality, its just basics)  http://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/fire-supression/83-sprinklerspacing.html  so, from this link, we can say, the distance between the sprinkler heads A & B can be determined by the area covered by distance A (distance must have a minimum over lapse)  and for the fire alarms, usually, a light should be blinking on the FAS system. If there is no source of lighting indication, then these might be battery operated, and so checking would be simple. If battery operated, first open the battery case cover, light a lighter/candle for a few seconds, and as soon as the buzzer goes on, remove one of the batteries. That should prove that the FAS works.  If it is building controlled, consult with the building owner first before taking any drastic steps..  Maybe these helps...good luck with your inspection tomorrow!
Q2911_C14	Very informative, thank you Very informative, thank you ani_chy. I am not looking to take drastic steps. I just want to know what the laws are regarding fire-safety and if our daycare is conforming to these laws. For the price we are paying, I certainly hope so. If they are not, then my child will not be attending in the future, and I will be contacting the appropriate authorities.

Q2918_C2	RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? If you working on a single status then I think it would be very difficult. As generally nannies/house maid are for families. You are stating single mom.. Now that beggers the question are you married or not. If you are not married then that might be another problem as you will be required to produce the marriage certificate at the immigration department..

Q2918_C4	RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? i think you should have no problem, but the papers you will require are a bit troublesome.... anyways, with the new requirements here are the papers you will need for the approval (ive been through this proceedure just a month ago).  1- your passport copy with a copy of your RP. 2- your child/childrens passport copy with a copy of their RPs. 3- Marraige/divorce Certificate. 4- Salary Certificate from your employer with date of employment. preferably certified from the housing department (but in that case you will need 2 copies of your salary certificate, as one copy stays with the housing dept) 5- Bank Account Statement from your bank, preferably stamped from the bank.  then you must type out the application form (you can type it out at the immigration office) identifying which nationality you will be employing.  then you go to building no. 4 to apply the application with the attached papers required. they give you a follow up slip that has the visa request number on it. you can track the application online at www.moi.gov.qa  if its approved then "Mabrook!" otherwise you have to go upstairs and talk to the manager and he should "approve" it for you after you tell him why you need the helper!  good luck! need any help let me know!

Q2922_C8	If you are still interested in learning the language, send me a msg and I will introduce you to an Arabic teacher who has been teaching in certified Qatari Schools for 28 years.

Q2922_C11	do you mean locals rezyz  do you mean locals should give privet classes for people who needs ??  there are noooooooo qatari gives classes and this will not happen   this job is for  people from north africa   not for us
Q2922_C12	Don't be a snob qatari citizen Do you think you are superior to North Africans? As I said there are local women who teach Arabic.   And there are alternatives to people from the magreb teaching Arabic. Look at all the people here from Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt (although I wouldn't study Egyptian Arabic because every other Arab laughs at you).
Q2922_C13	for qatari citizen for ur information north africans are tunisian and moroccan and if u claim that  it is up to them ti teach arabic then u assert that they are arabs or how could they teach a language they do not speak! allow me to say that u r speaking out of ignorance! it is true we are not 100% pure arabs but the islamic openenigs were centuries ago! we speak better arabic than u and better french than u and better english than u despite the fact that we dont use it on a daily basics! as for me i have a BA in english literature and teaching! i have a good accent as well as we have special courses for pronunciation and speaking! as for my writings i do teach better than i write;) it is internet im not going 2b so formal:p
Q2922_C14	it is bcz of arabs like u it is bcz of arabs like u that we are excluding ourselves! but beware that there is no difference between arabs nor maghrebins nor any other ethnicity! bcz Allah look into our hearts and how pious we r!
Q2922_C15	Baya, you don't use English on a daily "basics"? I rest my case. This is not a case of "text speak"; it is a case of fluency and your post doesn't reflect solid knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary . Also, I have heard Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians speak English, even ones that earned a university degree in English, and their pronunciation is never that of a native speaker. A good friend of mine has a Moroccan wife who has a PhD in English from one of their major universities and although her grammar and vocabulary was great, she couldn't really tutor because students wanted someone who had a native accent and 99 times out of a hundred, that will not be someone who studied English in a foreign university.   Sorry, but my wife was an English teacher for many years and still tutors, and I am still surprised at what passes for "teaching" in many cases.
Q2922_C16	And don't get me started on verb agreement, such as "Allah <b>look<u>s</u></b> into our hearts".... ;)  Stick to teaching Arabic, my dear :)
Q2922_C17	soooooooooo soooooooo any institutions here??
Q2922_C18	I advised Shiz. Go to Al Fanar. They have classes for men and women (separately) and even teach the Qatari dialect. Plus they are nice people there. :)
Q2922_C19	are you that stupid to Baya  are you that stupid to say that you know arabic more than me !!!  by the way i think i know you because there is only a few tunisian in Qatar who teaches English and franch   and i can reach you easily for saying that you speak arabic better than me   we will see then who can speak arabic and i will see if  you dare to say this in my face     this is the internet and every one can say whatever he or she want  but in the real world you will shrink like an ant in front of me

Q2922_C29	your perception is wrong your perception is wrong about tunisians or morrocons... they speak good arabic and french too... one can easily understand them... they use to speak with one another in their native accent...
Q2922_C30	Don't they have Arabic taught by natives at Al Fanar? My wife took a course there not too long ago. I think her teacher was a qatari woman.
Q2922_C31	Baya, I hope you don't teach English the way you write! :)    Every non-native speaker who knows some English seems to fancy themselves an English tutor but people should remember that accent is an important part of learning a language. Remember, you get what you pay for.
Q2922_C32	ask any local to teach ask any local to teach english or french, even they know it to full extent but they can't manage to teach...! teaching itself is a tough job, you have to first prepare yourself to speak out...

Q2931_C1	RE: US Educational Group Which ones are you thinking about?
Q2931_C2	RE: US Educational Group Mandilulr, Frankly there were so many but what i prefered the most are: Kentucky university and Virginia Commonwealth University; Roger Williams University is good too but its fees are even higher...  So still not sure bout it, besides i need also to kno which state is better to be at !  So what you think ?
Q2931_C3	RE: US Educational Group Wow, you are looking at VERY different schools. The University of Kentucky is a large (huge) state school offering almost all possible course of study and where the students will be mostly from Kentucky. Roger Williams is a small, elite liberal arts school in Rhode Island. If you like Virginia Commonwealth, your best bet is to stay in Doha rather than going all the way to Richmond, Virginia. There are thousands and thousands of school in the US, you may want to narrow them down by size, majors offered and geographical area. Not to mention admissions criteria! By the way, you are getting late for admissions for next fall.
Q2931_C4	RE: US Educational Group PS, they will ALL be very expensive these days! Minimum of $25,000 USD per year for tuition and expenses.
Q2931_C5	RE: US Educational Group Yea im a little bit late but this is intentional, coz im not plannin to go straight ahead, im lebanese working in Qatar, and movin to USA is not that easy thing, it needs planning and previous studies including financial status and lively hood and so on.... you are right regarding the tuition fees, all exceeded 25000 $ , but they have scholarships at to 12000$ and a student ccan work up to 20 hrs per week and so on... so we'll c ...i think im gonna go for that by 2010  thanks for the help :D Enjoy!

Q2936	Finger Print Location Dear Friends,  Can you please tell me the location for finger print office in doha.  Thanks
Q2936_C1	RE: Finger Print Location Keep on Salwa road. (this is the main road that radiates out of Doha from the Ramada signal and takes you to the Saudi Border). So, keep on Salwa Road and you will cross Midmac round-about (now a flyover) Decoration round-about, Wholesale Market round-about, Aziziya round-about and another small round-about before coming to the new flyover which has replaced Industrial Area round-about. Go straight over the Industrial Area flyover, and keep to the right lane. About 500 mts after the flyover, and just before the next interchange, there is a road to the right, perpendicular to the main road. Take this right turn and on your right hand side is the new CEID department building where you can have your finger prints taken. I got it done for my family in less than 15 minutes.

Q2941_C1	Tony, there are French Tony, there are French schools in Qatar? Never heard of them..;/
Q2941_C2	tonyhanna1, I would suggest tonyhanna1, I would suggest you a few points to avoid regret in future; Just after your arrival, as a parent you should visit both schools yourself. You should check the school's curriculum; activities plan and the academic calendar...ask for the strength of the particular class and see the premises... If youre satisfied by all means, then decide yourself where to enroll your child.

Q2941_C7	Jack any such institutes Jack any such institutes propagating any banned ideologies like homosexuality are not allowed in Qatar!
Q2941_C8	Jack they teach you all about Jack they teach you all about 'candle in the hind'
Q2941_C9	Thank you and WoW Thank you Edifis, I agree that your summary is a great insight into these institutions. It will surely help us in making our decision! I'll get back to you on it (hehe nice comment about the gauls btw)
Q2941_C10	Level of French Dear Edifis,As we are finalizing our move to Qatar, I thought I'd ask you this question. We were told that the level of French in Voltaire might be low due to the blend with non-French speakers. Do you know anything about that?
Q2941_C11	great reviews! Dear Edifis, on the contrary ur reviews were very helpful! are u in the field of education? that is what made me want to know more from you
Q2941_C12	Voltaire or Bonaparte? Bonaparte is probably much more famous than Voltaire. Apart from "Candide", no one bothers with Voltaire's literary works any more. Yes, he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought, but Napoleon's influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound. I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler, as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe, from the gates of Moscow to Madrid. On the other hand, Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide. To be fair to Napoleon, it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms. So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815, but he certainly continued them, very successfuly for a long while, and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons.
Q2941_C13	Both are good schools Both are good schools but Bonaparte will teach your kids to become a good leader but they concentrate mainly on outdoor physical activities, manoeuvers & strategies. Horse riding and lances & swords are their speciality. They also concentrate on proper health hygiene & sanitation and frequently remind the kid about properly using water in the loo..which the gauls generally dislike!  So they will make a good manager & strategist of you kid!  on the other hand Voltaire will make your child more of a philosopher! They encourage independent thinking...and mainly concentrates on indoor activities! They inculcate good moral values in the child and he will surely grow up to be a thinking person! In school they encourage kids to read great works of science and fiction. The literary skills in your kid will bloom. In addition they also teach the art of candid photography & journalism! Specialization: Wit & sattire in poetry & Prose!
Q2942	we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. my husband and i wish to combine our salary to make it 7k riyal so that we can sponsor our daughter in the philippines.  she is 4 years old. is it possible for us to do that. please advise, thank you
Q2942_C1	RE: we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. You or your husband must have a Family status visa and earn more than QR4500. If either of you earn at least Qr4500 per month you can ask your employer to change your visa to a Family visa. Then you can bring your daughter in and do the requirements.  Without the minimum salary of one person, they wont normally change your visa status (unless you know someone, who knows someone)
Q2942_C2	RE: we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. Ok, you need to do couple of things: 1- NOC from your employer addressing the ministry of interior 2- certificate of salary no less then QR7000. (used to be QR4500) 3- Bank statement of salary for at least 6 months 4- a copy of your reisdence electricy bill 5- a copy of your accommodation bill 6- Marriage certificate - a copy of the passport of the mother.

Q2956_C1	Can not stay... As per the law, its true... unmarried couples can not stay together in the same place, but trust me... There are alot of unmarried couples staying together here. The only way to go abt it is by not making a major talk-show abt it.
Q2956_C2	what if.. Thanks for replying. But what if neighbours or God knows who report me in? How sensitive is this matter in Qatar?

Q2956_C6	So you're saying that So you're saying that slandering a school is more serious than co-habiting with a member of the opposite sex who isn't your spouse?
Q2956_C7	yes tallq slandering a school can be serious especially if it is not true and for your information the owner of that school building is working from the government at Qatar University. so Pike is in serious trouble there. but individually cases like living with someone who is not their spouse is not a big deal for them as too many of these case here. I'll give you an example. One of my neightbor send her maid to jail when the maid stole some of her jewelries and some money and run off with a local guy. the maid was sent to jail for 1 year for stealing and not for running away with the guy who helped her. The lawyer told the maid's sponsor it is the maids business if she wants to practise her sexual activities with other man although the maid is married back home.

Q2956_C9	Thanks everyone Thanks everyone. I read through all the comments. I guess it is a sticky situation to begin with. I am still a little confused. Maybe I'll just have a talk with my girlfriend and see what is the best way for us to work this out. Thanks for all the advice.
Q2956_C10	there is no any problem for there is no any problem for the VISITORS! as Shaine said she might be one of your family members who is just visiting Qatar and you happened to live and work here...Don't announce the whole world about your relationship and you will be all right. She only came to VISIT you, nothing wrong with that. And dont think that I advise to violate the law. Again, you definitely cannot live together while both are working here, you cannot be common-in-law here. But visiting definitely everyone can come and visit his/her friends here, nothing wrong with that  <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2956_C14	One other issue to consider One other issue to consider is whether or not you will be in company housing. People tend to be a little more judgmental when they are sharing the same accomodations. Hotels are best. Mandi
Q2956_C15	dan281 first of all you don't need to inquire your situation here. second of all expect both negative and positive answers. and third of all you don't tell to other people that she is just your girlfriend that you live together in 1 roof it's not their business to know, for goodness sake this is not Saudi Arabia. you just have to be careful to bump to any nosey people that may report you. Chill out enjoy your time with your love ones!
Q2956_C16	Jamon, your advice may be Jamon, your advice may be well-meaning but perhaps not very accurate. Yes, there are people who will say yes and no but Dan needs to consider the issues and consequences. His profile says that he is a pilot. IF (an assumption) he is working for QR and living in their housing and his girlfriend sashays in and out every couple of months I suspect that he will be busted sooner than later. QR is pretty strict. He will have to decide if it's worth losing his job and being deported for violating company policy as well as Qatar law. Can he get away with it? Yes, probably for a while. Will he? I suspect not and the consequences are severe. It's not just a slap on the wrist. Mandi
Q2956_C17	If someone reports you If someone reports you you'll must probably be deported.  jamon - I think it is illegal for an un-married man and woman to live in the same house, even if they aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, so not telling people she is your girlfriend will make no difference.  also jamon - I find it odd your encouraging someone to break the law while in another thread you are mentioning that CID watch the site and will trace IPs and act on things if they're reported.

Q2975_C1	Everything is available Everything is available here...on double price.
Q2975_C2	Yes Not only Mothercare, but there are more similar shops where you can buy what ever you want
Q2975_C3	-- the main ones will be mothercare and babyshop. i had stumbled upon a baby/mother department in Lulu supermarket/hypermarket, which offers pretty good range of things you need. let me know if you have anything in mind that you think you might not find it here in Doha. so that you dont have to buy from UK.
Q2975_C4	Yup Mother care is here, so Yup Mother care is here, so is baby shop which both are very good quality and stuff.
Q2975_C5	mothercare / babyshop / max / mothercare / babyshop / max / Jameel / the wear house and many more you will discover more when you will arrive
Q2975_C6	P, etc Yes Mothercare, ELC, M&P, etc are here - but not reasonably priced, you will see the price in pounds and then the extortionate price in riyals.  I only buy what I have to from here, everything else I bring over from the UK...
Q2975_C7	Just to give you an idea...in Just to give you an idea...in M&S I picked up a pair of shoes for my little one, the price tag said 16 and QAR150...
Q2975_C8	true say Snessy you are true say Snessy you are right. I would buy everything from the UK   They are definitely double the price and in some cases triple
Q2975_C9	I've experienced the same I've experienced the same snessy. I got 1 piece of maternity blouse here for almost QR500. With the same amount, I was able to buy 4 to 5 pairs in the Phils, better quality, nicer design. Some of their prices are TERRIBLE.
Q2975_C10	-- just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need, you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply, just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things, which are not in Qatar, from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff, you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too, like car and petrol.
Q2976	Alibaba Website - Any Comments I was searching for some spare parts for my car, and found the same online in a website "based in China" called "alibaba.com":  - anybody heard of the same?  - anybody ordered anything from them?  - they said that they will send the parts by DHL but they want the payment in advance, can I trust them? any comments on this subject will be appreciated?  Thanks
Q2976_C1	Alibaba I have found that they don't respond to emails and seem to be focused on very big businesses wanting to set up large export details. my advice is that if you want to do business in China you need an agent that you can trust in China. I would steer well away from ordering anything on the web from China.
Q2976_C2	You can Order. As i order Some car parts and i got it on time, No problem i have also send them in Advance as i talked to the person on phone and order via Alibaba, you can go head.
Q2976_C3	use ebay, better use ebay, better
Q2976_C4	@osama Are you buying the part from Alibaba OR from some supplier registered on Alibaba??
Q2977	Baby's visa Hi,my wife will be arriving with the new born baby next month. My wife is having RP upto september end. Our child will be 2 months and 6 days old when they arrive. So, is a Visa required for my child? I have heard that for 3 months no visa is required. So please let me know the rule for such a case. Thank you in advance
Q2977_C1	RE: Baby's visa Visa is not required for a baby of lessthan 3 month old who will accompany his/her mother. Visa will be issued after their arrival on condition that mothers passport must carry a valid RP.
Q2977_C2	RE: Baby's visa If the age of your new born baby is less than 3 month no need for visa, but the birth certificate should be there and it should be attested by Qatar embassy in your home country. I did this way when I brought my daughter 3 month ago, she was 40 days old only.
Q2977_C3	RE: Baby's visa My friend, me too just got my baby visa stamped today only. when i checked, i came to know that it is for two [2] months only. New born Baby can travel anywhere with only passport without visa for two [2] months only. If it exceeds even one day, you have to apply for the sponsorship for the child. This is what recently updated. since my baby born in qatar, i got it done within two [2] months and each day penalty will be Qrs. 10/- will be charged.
Q2977_C4	RE: Baby's visa DONT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE COMMENTS, SOME ONE MISGUIDE ME ALSO WHEN I BRING MY CHILD IT IS STILL 3 MONTH, AND I WAS FORCED TO BRING MY CHILD WITHIN 2 MONTHS, YOU CAN BRING YOUR CHILD WITHIN 90 DAYS AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY VISA. UP ON ARRIVAL THEY WILL GIVE YOU ONE MONTH VISA AND WITHIN ONE MONTH YOU NEED TO STAMP YOUR CHILD'S VISA. IT IS TOO EASY.
Q2977_C5	RE: Baby's visa My friend. I suggest you to go personally to Immigration dept. and enquire everthing over there. You better try to get information from the typist over there. they are highly informative and updated.
Q2977_C6	RE: Baby's visa A baby born out of DOHA if travels within 90 days (from its country of birth to doha) from the date of his/her born, there is no need of any VISA for new born.. The only thing is that both the parents should have valid RP inorder to bring the NEW BORN without visa..A baby can get visa on arrival.. Make sure that your wife should bring BIRTH CERTIFICATE alongwith her.. Some related link as per your query to give you more idea..thnx http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1171487 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1231842
Q2977_C7	RE: Baby's visa The new rule states that - "If the birth was occurred outside the country and father and mother or one of them possess valid residence permit in the country, the new born baby can enter the country within two years from the date of birth."  Here is a link to the page which states the above:   http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/news/2009/12/14/21278.html  Hope this helps.
Q2978	Mashreq Credit card anybody knows here regarding my outstanding balance in my credit card in mashreq bank. Do I need to pay my remaining balance in my credit card if I will be terminated?
Q2978_C1	RE: Mashreq Credit card If you were terminated by your employer and you have the credit shield option, then the insurance will pay for your outstanding. Ask Mashreq bank if you have credit shield
Q2978_C2	RE: Mashreq Credit card what most people dont understand is that there are terms and condition for Credit shield   these are some of them that I remember when i was in the bank 1. Regualar payments  2. its takes 90 days to get approved in that time you still have to pay if you miss once it doesnt work. 3. Honestly being in the credit card section you will not believe the way you get ripped off.  4. Your company has to be listed.  5. termination not because of bad behavior or anything thats your Fault  7. Credit shield is a pain in the ass.   How i manage my credit card its unbelievable.  I have not cancelled my credit shield but i have never paid for it too  how do i do tht i make my payments before the bill is made as in i make the full payments.

Q2979	Maple Syrup Where can i find good quality Maple Syrup? The particular recipe requires a good "GRADE B" Maple Syrup.Im not sure what that is..help ?
Q2979_C1	RE: Maple Syrup i think i have seen it in MegaMart. But i personally bring it straight from Canada.
Q2979_C2	RE: Maple Syrup try to visit THE CENTER behind ramada hotel u can maple serup there!!!
Q2979_C3	RE: Maple Syrup You can find maple syrup in MegaMart, but it's not cheap.  I don't know if it will be Grade A or Grade B, though. I *think* I've even seen small bottles at Carrefour. . .and ditto on the price.  Don't worry too much about the Grade A vs Grade B.  The grocery stores tend to sell Grade A because consumers associate "A" with being superior to "B".  The Grade B does have a slightly nicer flavor, but Grade A will work just fine in your recipes.  Like someone else mentioned, we bring ours in from the U.S. because it's much much less expensive. I think I brought at least three or four liters with me!  Enjoy :o)
Q2979_C4	RE: Maple Syrup Have you tried Giant at Hyatt Plaza. They have an aisle that is full of imported good from the USA.
Q2979_C5	RE: Maple Syrup Well ok im gonna try the Crntre and then Mega mart, wish i had asked my mom to bring in maple syrup from canada she just visited about 2 months ago. Anyways i hope i find good ones here. Thanks all!
Q2980	will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? Ive been here to Doha a month ago and I have a business visa. My employer is already processing my working visa. If ever I will resign and tranfer to another company, will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? What are the problems will I encounter? Please help.
Q2980_C1	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If you don't have a Residence Permit you are not required to obtain an N.O.C. so from what i understand of your question, you are free to change employers at any time.
Q2980_C2	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If ever you resign from your existing sponsor, you will require NOC(no objection certificate) from your last sponsor to again get a visa. If you resign & exit Qatar then for 2 years you cannot get a work visa without the previous sponsors NOC.
Q2980_C3	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? if you already have KAMA KALAS YOU NEED NOC TO CHANGE SPONSORSHP AND THS VERY DFFCULT BECUSE MOST OF SPONSORSHPS EVEN F YOU FNSHNG CONTRACT DURATON THEY DONT LKE TO GVE NOC THE MPORTANT S F YOU DDNT GO FNGER SCAN NO PROBLEM GO HOME AND CHANGE THE PASSPORT AND COME BY NEW VSA ( FNGER PRNT VERY MPORTANT ) GOOD LUCK
Q2980_C4	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? I disagree to Mohan Thomas, even she resigns so long as she's not resident in qatar, then she's free to comeback here in doha in another visa.
Q2980_C5	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? You said "processing" so it means you are not yet sponsored by your current employer.  You can resign but bear in mind that you have a limited time to stay here for a business visa or else you have to pay the penalty when your visa expires.  So if u will resign, make sure there is one position ready for you and willing to give sponsorship or even pay the penalty when your visa expires during processing.  Goodluck!!!
Q2980_C6	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? You have to do the following actions before you go for medical and fingerprint processes if you want to change the job, 1. Resign from present job.  2. Go back to your origin.  3. Come back with new employer. You cannot change job here itself, coz your sponsor is present employer. All the best
Q2980_C7	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If your employer has paid for your coming to Doha and your visa he will probably not look too kindly on your taking the opportunity to find another job. Transferring your employment means an NOC. If your sponsor hasn't processed your RP but has paid for everything it would be immoral to use this loophole to skip on him. These kinds of shenanigans are the reason for the strict laws in Qatar.
Q2980_C8	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? Mandilulur, FYI my present company is trimming down their manpower everyday. Most of my co-workers have been given their termination papers, after that they won't care about what happens to you. I don't want to wait for my turn. I just want to know my options. Our situations are not being considered in this case. I have no bad intentions towards my company but I'm just looking after my livelihood and survival. Thanks for your comments.
Q2980_C9	RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? The first issue here you enter in Qatar with Business Visa it is renewable up to 90 days. Second,the company who issued you a business visa it is your sponsor, if you working visa still on process with the same sponsor you are not allowed to look for new sponsor. Third, if you came here and use business visa as your entry document and your purpose is to look for other company, still you need NOC from your sponsor, I mean from the company who issued you a business visa.

Q2992_C19	suzan, thank Allah I'm not a suzan, thank Allah I'm not a coffee person at all. I enjoy my Rainbow and Lipton when I'm in the mood. As for SAVING, since that is your question. I think it is pretty simple. Start from the first day. When you get your salary, ex. Qr10,000, set aside Qr2,000 in a saving account that you would open. Make sure you make it a standing monthly order, so your brain will function to accept that your salary is only Qr8,000 and you would have to manage with that. Maybe you would want to start small, but 20% of your monthly pay is a great start. Then you can increase it when you manage to settle into the saving/budgeting lifestyle.   Good luck!
Q2992_C20	My tips are: <i>1:Avoid to purchase such items in advance which you think might be rarely used by you. 2: Try to compare product prices with similar products especially buying groceries/household items. 3: Avoid branded products maximum if possible e.g. Shirts,pants,trousers & shoes which can be purchased with very less prices in Musheirib Street,Souq Najada or Souq Area. 4: Maximum avoid eating from outside. 5: Try your luck by investing your savings as much as you can in DOHA BANK ALDANA SCHEME, AHLI BANK'S MY HASSAN SAVING CERTIFICATES or NATIONAL BONDS-UAE. May be you might get lucky and win MILLION RIYALS. . Sadly, I'm unable to follow none of them after getting married. :P :P :P </i>
Q2992_C21	Furthermore, <i>1: Give miss calls to others and let them call you to save your QTEL BILLS  :P :P 2: Spend maximum time in malls to save KAHRAMA bills. :P :P 3: Visit other family or friends houses just at dinner/lunch times so you can share their food and save money too :P :P  4: Why to spend money on ADSL line when you have free ADSL LINE in parks :P :P 5: Take lifts from your colleagues to & from your house to save patrol money :P :P </i>
Q2993	can i sign in hindhi language in passport Will it be a ny problem if i sign in hindhi language in indian passport '
Q2993_C1	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport No Problem. You can sign in any script in any of your language. But it should not differ from one another it should be same every time you use.
Q2993_C2	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport It should be HINDI...right?
Q2993_C3	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport dude you first need to learn to spell the language properly.   i suggest you sign in Malayalam in your passport. It would be easy for you to remember.
Q2993_C4	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Even if you draw a monkey face as your signature it will be accepted. It is the consistency and duplication that matters which requires a simple yet not so easy to copy sign from you.
Q2993_C5	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Do not do it.  One day your PP would be going along with other documents like , banks, property issues, PAN Card, UID etc. Then you may face some difficulty.
Q2993_C6	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Your signature has got nothing to do with language. it could be any design, mark, clip art or any thing drawable consistently over and over and difficult to imitate by someone else. It is not expected to be 'read' but to be 'identified'.
Q2993_C7	RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Molten Metal..If it has to be read, about a quarter of the world population will not be able to sign.I have seen a lot of the older and simpler folks going for just one letter like "Aa","Om" etc with some dots and decimals put here and there as they like it..Some even put cross,pictures,etc.My maid  signed her name "Usha" beautifully in the Passport I took for her. It took me some time later on to realise, that is the only word she knew to "draw"...   :-(

Q3010_C4	What would you Thank you!    What would you consider to be the best ranked schools in Doha?  Being from Canada we are looking for an American or IB curriculum to ease the transition when we return.  We will apply to ASD, but as you suggested, unlikely we will secure spots.  So we are left with ACS and ISL as I understand it.  Any others I am missing?  Thanks so much!!
Q3010_C5	ACS is your best bet after ACS is your best bet after ASD.  ASD and ACS are the only schools that truly follow an American curriculum.  it is new, but really has gotten off to a good start.  Parents are happy there.  QA is great but difficult to get in if you are not Qatari or work for QF.  Plus, the behavior of certain children who go there is rediculous.  Teachers afraid to discipline kids with a particular last name, so those kids run wild.
Q3010_C6	Hi ComingtoDoha! Any luck Hi ComingtoDoha! Any luck with Your school search?  I'm moving to Doha too from Canada and have been searching and searching.  Would love any help in this matter! ASD seems like the best option, am I right?
Q3011	Do I need a lawyer? I had rented a car from a local company, they needed the car back for 1 day to get it registered. They gave me a loaner car to use and the loaner car broke down while I was driving it. The car rental company is saying its my fault and that I have to pay for a new engine on the loaner car.   I refused to pay and the car rental place said it will send it to the police and the courts.  I am an American female.  any advice?
Q3011_C1	RE: Do I need a lawyer? Tell them to go ahead.  Unless you were negligent, it's their problem.  You didn't take a sledgehammer to it, did you?  You didn't put something other than motor oil in, did you?  Seems to me you'd REALLY have to try hard to blow an engine in one day.
Q3011_C2	RE: Do I need a lawyer? Hello,  I would definately discuss  with a lawyer.  Did you sign a contract?  If so there should be a limitation on the amount you have to pay eg 1500 QAR in the event of a accident etc.  However, I wouldn't pay anything yet.  If you were driving the car normailly and were not in an accident that was your fault, then the problem is theres.  They provided a car that wasn't safe or suitable for normal driving.  Depending on what your lawyer says you could tell them you are going to call the police against them and see what they say.  They might back down (again speak to someone who knows if there are any ramifications for this!)  It may also be advantagous to have someone call on your behalf.  There are bound to be some lawyers in here who can give you some quick advice.  All the best, if you need anything please PM me.  Cheers
Q3011_C3	RE: Do I need a lawyer? Its not your fault you dont have to pay. you only pay if you do an accident. if they provided you with a scarp and it broke its their its their fault. Go to police
Q3011_C4	RE: Do I need a lawyer? and make sure if you feel that they are going to report you to the police you reach the authorities first else their false claims will get you then and you will have to pay then. if the police cant decide IN YOU FAVOR THEN GO FOR A LAWYER.
Q3011_C5	RE: Do I need a lawyer? The problem with the replacement car must be serious as the engine brokedown. It maybe by accident then the insurance will take care of it, but if by negligent then someone to pay.. i think no need to find a lawyer just simple as that.
Q3011_C6	RE: Do I need a lawyer? let them go to the police or to the court as they said,it's better for you since investigation be conducted,then wait and see the results..if you feel that you're not satisfied with the outcome,that's the time you will seek for a legal opinion...am sure you will win this case...its not your liability at all....

Q3016	Gratuity Payments My co-worker has been working here in Qatar for over 25 years. As per Qatar Law please help me determine the number of weeks he is entitled for his Gratuity payments. I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. Is this correct? Kindly cite the article or law which states it. Thanks.
Q3016_C1	seems like you read the law, haven't you?? How come you say <b>" I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. Is this correct"</b>  and then you ask the people to cite the article...would rather suggest to you to go back to the law and get it right.  Contact a lawyer for support and guidance or go to the Ministry of Labour for details.  Regards!!!
Q3016_C2	he is entitled to as i know, he is entitled to receive payment woth 3 weeks per every year starting from the year the law was effective (2003 or 2004 i can't remember) to his last basic salary.    Yalla!
Q3016_C3	I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. I read it in a newspaper article but I couldn't find it in the Labor law. I hope to see written expressly in the labor law. Hope you could help me find it.
Q3016_C4	If his contract doesn't If his contract doesn't state anything to the contrary, I believe at minimum he is entitled to 3 weeks salary for every year worked = in his case 25 years x 3 weeks = 75 weeks or about 1.5 years last salary (not an average or his original pay but his latest).  However, some employers do state they will pay more than the labour law stipulates.  He should check his contract.  His employer is NOT allowed to pay less than the minimum the labour law has approved. If in doubt or dispute, he should contact a reputable lawyer.  This is a substantial sum of money.  Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"
Q3016_C5	check article 54, Qatar check article 54, Qatar Labour Law of 2004, it's stated there unless that law doesn't apply to your mate or has been revise, nevertheless you get there your required info.  <BR> ^_^ imho

Q3019	How is Belgium??? Hi  I am interested in knowing more about Belgium. How is the place? The cost of living compared to other european countries. Are the people there fluent in english? The modes of transportation and areas of tourist interest?  All relevant suggestions welcome.  Thank you .
Q3019_C1	Belgium has some fantastic Belgium has some fantastic tourist locations that would take maximum 4 days to see if you were on a snail's pace.  Brussels is an awesome city to visit as well as live. I find it as cosmopolitan as Paris or London. Other great cities to visit are Brugge, Ghent and Antwerp. If you want a little seaside action you can head up to Knocke or Blankenberge.  From my experiences as a foreigner in Belgium have been that in the Flemish speaking (Not German, Paul) areas are a little less acceptant of differences in the way people look and will definately stare and ogle.  But in Brussels and its suburbs there is none of that what so ever... and none in the southern French speaking areas really from my experiences.  There are quite a few 'halal' restaurants in Brussels. Particularly between Gare de Midi and the Arab quarter of the city.  They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to see it... --George Carlin
Q3019_C2	Not everyone would love Not everyone would love brussels , it is a bit old ... u will even find them selling those toys made of wood ... and lots of old stuff ...   The oldest mall " Galleries Royales St-Hubert " and it is a must see ....  also the grand place isnice specialy if they have the flower festival or whatever it is called .  Dont forget to enjoy the chocolat and check the dimonds :)
Q3019_C3	Belgium is nearer to France Belgium is nearer to France than UK.. Which is very good.  Famous for child sex cases.  They eat Frites.  They drink beer.  Following will hopefully summarise belgiuns..    A Belgian came into a bar and ordered a beer. The waiter put a coaster and a beer on the table.  Ten minutes later the Belgian ordered another beer. The waiter brought him the beer and saw that the coaster had disappeared. So he fetched another one..  Ten minutes later, another beer. And again the coaster was missing. This time the waiter decided he would not lay down another coaster..  - "Hey" the Belgian said, "where's my cookie ?"
Q3019_C4	correction, Belgium speaks Dutch, not German! The official languages in Belgium are dutch (or Flamish to be accurate)and French. THere is a tiny area where people speak German, but this is not regarded as an official language associated with Belgium.  If you go to the tourist area's (Knokke, Brugge, gent etc) or the big cities like Liege, Antwerp or Brussels you'll be fine.  In the coutry-side or smaller villages people might make foreigners feel ''unwelcome''.  Overall Belgium is a lovely place to visit, great places of sight seeing and amazing food too.

Q3019_C6	Belgians independence n 1830 the Belgians revolted and declared their independence. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was chosen king in 1831. The Dutch invaded later that year. After years of negotiation, an armistice was arranged. The Treaty of London, signed in 1839, established Belgium as an independent state, whose sovereignty and neutrality were guaranteed by all of the European powers. ----------- smithsan <a href="http://makemoney.bizoppjunction.com" rel="do follow">Make Money</a>

Q3021_C6	RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION Sanchar Deb - I have recently been going thru this process myself in our office for our staff and a colleague of mine - 2 of them in fact - both had only their Xeroxed copies attested first by their embassies and then by MOFA. One is from Pakistan and the other from Sri Lanka.   When another staff from India went for the same procedure he was told to have the originals attested and was also told that this applied only to Indians.   Now who has the right procedure? Cause each time you get conflicting reports on this. There doenst seem to be any concrete rule per se. and honestly it is rather tiring.
Q3021_C7	RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION Please visit: http://www.education.nic.in/circulars/archival_auth.htm  and  http://www.mea.gov.in/myprint.php?id=8801&d=06&m=&y=&pg=&flg=&searchdata1=  You need to get your degree attested first from State Secretariat at Mumbai, as you have passed your B.Tech from Maharashtra. Then, you will have to get it attested by any Regional Office of Ministry of External Affairs, located in some state capitals and in New Delhi. Upon endorsement by Ministry of External Affairs, just go to Qatar Embassy in India, and get it ratified.  Now, your degree is perfect and you will not face any problem in Qatar for any further ratification from Indian Embassy in Qatar and Ministry of External Affairs of Qatar.

Q3026_C1	RE: Driving licence Change if u think that u r perfect in driving and no need to take any driving course then u can show your korean license and directly give the test to get qatar driving license.if u dont have any idea about qatar driving then join a short course and try to get it
Q3026_C2	RE: Driving licence Change I suggest you take a driving class before taking driving test. Most of the guys I know even having a professional drivers license issued from their country of origin fails the driving test (if you did not attended a driving class).
Q3026_C3	RE: Driving licence Change No driving test is required. It is possible to change South Korean driving license. First you need to translate the license into English either with Embassy or with a recognized translating agency. Then apply with eye test report & standard driving license application along with the translated paper. Good Luck!

Q3029	How to find a home for three kittens? I am leaving the country soon and would like to give away three kittens that I have been taking care of over the past few years. Their names are "he", "she", and "her" and they are adorable. I need to find them a home before I leave because they will be at great risk if I return them to the street. What is a good way of giving them away?

Q3029_C3	RE: How to find a home for three kittens? The responsibility of pet ownership does not cease when it becomes "inconvenient".  Why don't you take them with you?  All you need is the correct paperwork, a cat carrier or two and the willingness to try.  As for putting them on the street, better they should be euthanized rather than having them starve, get beat up by other cats, run over by a car, or tortured by some of the misguided children.  It's good you're trying to find them a new home, and perhaps your circumstances are such that you really can't take them with you.  But under no circumstances should you put them out to fend for themselves.  Good luck.

Has anyone gotten them more than once?

Q3038_C2	health Good health will never be realized unless there is good hygiene (nothing about the poor lady with mumpy sons) 1. clean drinking water 2. good sanitation 3. good personal hygiene - washing and no spitting  that may explain partly why immunised people still get TB

Q3038_C4	mumps I wonder if perhaps the vaccine they got as babies was somehow a bad batch and therefore did not adequately protect the children.  And I completely disagree with the vaccinations are stupid remark.  Vaccinations have saved millions of lives.
Q3038_C5	DeeDee, if a baby or child's DeeDee, if a baby or child's immune system is not developed enough to be able to process the antibodies inside a vaccination then it is pointless and stupid.  Now if we are to discuss the meaning of this word vaccinate then what is being done is not vaccination as by definition a vaccination is to inoculate with a vaccine to produce immunity.   It is proven that this is not being done. How is it that 20% of TB cases in Qatar had been 'vaccinated' and received boosters?

Q3039_C2	RE: How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? well it all depends on the school you work, the grade you teach for and your qualification and experience. Please be specifice in all your quistions if some one has to help you. The suggestion of taking tution is really bad  most of the teachers in india seem to be so vague in class and that makes kids go for tution. The teachers must be ASHAMED  as they dont do their job sincerly though  the parents pay so much as school fee and you teachers  dont teach properly to gain students for tution. These teachers must be sacked

Q3040	Who is an expat? Hi All, I noticed that people selling their cars say that they are "expat" or "expat car".  Well, what does that mean?  Do "expat cars" bring more value than local folks' cars.  I know expat take care of their cars and spend money on it.  But, really .. who is an expat.  To me .. when I read the advert, I expect an native english speaker or europeans.  Is that so? or expat is just everyone who is not local?
Q3040_C1	In its broadest sense, an In its broadest sense, an expatriate is any person living in a different country from where he or she is a citizen. In common usage, the term is often used in the context of professionals sent abroad by their companies, as opposed to locally hired staff (who can also be foreigners). The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors, so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates, whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant'.  WIKI Dixit!
Q3040_C2	Anyone who is not a Anyone who is not a local..  by the way, beware of expats selling Dacias.
Q3040_C3	expatriates are also commonly expats are also commonly referred to as the infidels so the term expat is used only to soften the advertisement.  an advert saying "infidel wanting to sell car" wouldn't bring many responses i would imagine.
Q3040_C4	...Very good question. ...Very good question. Commonly, I see most of Qataris by expat they mainly mean Westerners, by residents they mean Arabs, by laborers them mean communities from certain countries.   When the Arab "expat" holds dual nationality, they point it out as a privilege. Who am I exactly in all of that, I have no clue.   Signed by: Laborer under the Labor Law of Qatar.
Q3040_C5	Expat is the one who is Expat is the one who is neither here nor there...neither X nor Y. He is an 'ex' for his home country and doesnt get any 'pat' from his adopted country.

Q3040_C17	Expat are non locals .. yeah right .. Expat are non locals.. Yeah right.. Not all of them.  To the locals, expats mean westerners.  Especially, white folks.  If you are an Arab with a westerner nationality, you are still called an arab with a westerner nationality.  That is true for Indians, Pakis,...etc. I think historically, the British expats who were here in the early days (70s, 80s) were a true representation of expats.  However, this has changed a lot through our the years.  I think the term "expats" now apply to a wider group of people. Anyway, all expats are welcome as they as they understand the culture. One sad thing though, is the separation between expats and locals.  There is a boundary and low engagement.  That is why those terms will still have a meaning.  I am really looking for that day, when this term "the way it means today" disappears!

Q3044_C2	What a nice way to frame the What a nice way to frame the question. Thought provoking too.  I haven't been here long enough, but I don't regret anything about moving here. Before coming here I looked up and read a lot about Qatar and the social scene(QL was a big part of getting info). Even when you come here, take your time when deciding where you want to stay. Get a feel of the place and neighborhood. Move around in places you might enjoy (malls, Souq, Katara, go to the orchestra etc), and choose which hangout you like best enough to be frequent in.   Is there any particular thing you are concerned about during this move?  All the best.

Q3044_C5	Nothing to be scared of. Nothing to be scared of. Qatar is a great place. The only thing I would have done differently is to ask that the company provide family housing, rather than having to find it myself.
Q3044_C6	Get any documents that you Get any documents that you will need (police clearance certificate, marriage certificate etc) attested before you move out. You can do it from here but it's more hassle.   Also, set up any savings accounts, ISAs etc you think you may need as once you're out here you'll be unable to set stuff up as an expat.  On top of that, if you have a shipping allowance bring as much as you can - particularly boks, CDs, DVDs etc. I brought just a couple of boxes and have since had to buy stuff which I had left in storage at home.

Q3052_C3	RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation they have their separate colony which includes, swimming pool,gym, etc. good one.
Q3052_C4	RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation Their Housing/other facilities are very good...but if the job is in IT, you have to be cautious before taking the offer.  They recently (8 months back)outsourced their IT to EDS, so there are very less 'direct hires' to QF in IT.  Even if you get hired, there is no gaurantee that you will have a job as they are very keen on Outsourcing and other important factor is the Qatarisation.  Please check with the HR/Hiring Managers on these anc make sure you have a clear understanding of the road ahead before jumping in.

Q3054	Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? Hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries? incl. dog collars, dog bed, bowls?
Q3054_C1	RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? I have found it rather hit or miss to find good quality dog toys/treats/medicines/dog beds.  I have found that I can order many of these on line and have them shipped here (hey, my dog is worth every Riyal).    http://www.dog-beds-n-beyond.com/coolaroodogbed.html is a website with a description and picture if you're interested.  Shop around, prices do vary.  I have also bought frontline and preventic collars to help prevent tick infestations on line.  hope this helps.
Q3054_C2	RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? As a continuation of my previous post, you can find somethings here, the prices can be more expensive (or less so when you take into consideration shipping etc.)  However, the bed is something I've never seen here.  I like it because it keeps the dog off the floor, easy on the joints - my dog is older, and cooler as the air circulates around it.  It is also easy to clean/wash and dries quickly.

Q3055	Is it a good salary? Hi there,  I got an offer to move to Qatar from US I currently have a good position in a good institution I've 8 years experience. The offer is around QAR45k/month with other perks.  How good it is?  How does it in Qatar in terms of negotiating higher salaries? It's hard to find resources related to Salaries in Qatar ...  Thanks ya'll
Q3055_C1	Very good offer.. Very good offer..
Q3055_C2	compare If you convert 45k to US dollars and you earn almost the same amount, then you better stay in the US. If not, don't hesitate, move to Qatar.  I have nothing against Qatar because the locals are now very adaptable people especially if you work in a well sought company. In fact you might probably feel that other arabs are more up to themselves. The way people drive there is crazy though. No discipline and road rage is massive! I had lived in Qatar for x amount of years so I know what it's like.  I will come back definitely...my passive lifestyle suits me to be there. good luck!
Q3055_C3	You really would have to give You really would have to give us an idea of the job and the company in order for us to answer that. It varies widely with position. Mandi

Q3055_C9	no its not enough don't come no its not enough don't come here.
Q3055_C10	I'll take half of that and will remain in the US.
Q3055_C11	Not only that, Mandi. The Not only that, Mandi. The replies also depend on where each individual poster is coming from. Generally, for Asians, QR45k is a lot but not so for some others. But QR45k all inclusive? Should also take into account the budget busters esp. accomodation.    Comingtoqatar - you can do a search on QL for your concerns and then ask specific questions if you still haven't found what you want to know and you might get some answers.   Btw, we're all volunteers, not people connected with the govt tourism or anything so pls don't be discouraged if you don't get proper answers sometimes. I say this cos there have been many times in the past where newbies ask questions and expect answers and get upset when there aren't any useful ones and then blame the QL site owners.

Q3057	Parking Ticket Can someone tell me where can I go and pay a parking ticket I got near the City Center Mall?
Q3057_C1	RE: Parking Ticket CLEAR YOUR QUESTION
Q3057_C2	RE: Parking Ticket Number 1. It must be by credit card.  Number 2. If there are no points associated with the ticket then you can pay on line.  Number 3. If there are points then you must go to one of the police stations... Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa, Airport Traffic on Tadmur and E Ring or one of the kiosks at the airport and I think some of the malls.  good luck  On #3 that may only be for cars that the sponsors own, if it is your personal vehicle and your Qatar license is is tied to the vehicle then you may be able to pay on line. But company cars cannot because they don't know whom to assign the points to.
Q3057_C3	RE: Parking Ticket Parking tickets usually have points (don't ask me why, they just do).  So you likely need pay in person.  Since you got it near City Center, easiest would be the MoI kiosk on the ground floor of CC, just under Carrefour.  Bring your credit or debit card (no cash) and your Drivers License.
Q3058	Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? Is anybody tried to use International driver's license here in Doha? Or do we need to take a half course of driving lesson to get a driver's license?
Q3058_C1	RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? I second what "UkEngQatar" says above, and will add that the car rental stations at the airport told me that it is only valid for your 1st 7 days upon arrival in Qatar.
Q3058_C2	RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? Please note, that an International Driving License is NOT a license - it is a translation of the license you currently hold - therefore it is not valid unless you also have your usual license. An international license is issued to simplify things for the licensing authorities in the country you are going to wish to drive in - all it does here in Qatar is speed up the conversion process.   The 7 day rule applies to certain nationalities that are permitted to drive here without having to retake their test - providing they enter with a tourist visa - an international license will not help you in this instance,  you must always show your original license - if anyone has found this to be different then I will be surprised.   And for those nationalities where a re-test is required here, an IL will not help - I believe you just have to grin and bear it and re-take the test again.
Q3058_C3	RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? International Driving license is valid for 6 months from the date of entry in Doha, provided that you dont have RP here.  I'm here on visit visa and driving on International license. Even I had an accident last month and I presented my International License with my passport to the Police officer at Maroor Traffic Police, and they accepted it. So, don't worry and go ahead.
Q3058_C4	RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? thanks for the information....highly appreciated..

Q3066	Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as consumer? I'm a first timer, and I'm still thinking of what carrier should I choose when buying a phone.  Things that I'm looking after are, cost of call, sms, International (Canada, Manila and Singapore).  Are there Prepaid and Postpaid subscription as well?  What can you say? Muchas Gracias,
Q3066_C1	RE: Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as... There are a lot of choices in Qatar. Both postpaid and prepaid are available. Virgin Mobile is prepaid only.  If you are looking for the best network, you want to buy Shari (postpaid), Hala (prepaid) or Virgin Mobile. All of these give you the Qtel network, which has much better coverage.  If you are looking for the best experience (buying, customer care, support, ...) then go with Virgin Mobile.  If you are looking for the lowest price, postpaid is cheaper if you expect to use the number of minutes that come with the Qtel or Vodafone bundles.  If you also expect to use the phone overseas or to call overseas, then things get complicated, because there are so many promotions lately.
Q3066_C2	RE: Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as... Currently, Vodaphone and Virgin mobile are new and trying to capture market by their attractive rates. But in reality, their reception quality is very bad indeed because they are building their sites yet.  So in this situation, QTEL is best or if you want to avail their packages, buy any cheap mobile set and use their SIM on that phone for only out going.

Q3067	Will Visa be provided in A4 sheet Hi ,  I recently got an offer with malomita through i2sbs.  I was asked to submit my passport and they said that i will be receiving my visa in a A4 sheet. And after reaching qatar only i will be getting my visa stamped in passport is that true??  Please advise...  Thanks, Praveen.
Q3067_C1	As meteris stated, company As meteris stated, company will apply for visa. It can take 2-3 days, but don't be surprised if it stretches to 2-3 weeks.
Q3067_C2	sound right You will be sent usually, by email a pdf copy of the Work Visa, when you arrive you show immigration along with your passport, they will give you a normal arrivals stamp in your passport one and also a stamp saying you should report to expatriate affairs within 1 month. Once you arrive, you will be blood typed, tested, x-rayed and have your finger prints taken and then once you have passed all of that your sponsor will apply for the residents permit which is a passport size sheet stuck in the passport, which states your occupation and visa type.
Q3067_C3	Hi ...Thanks for the Hi ...Thanks for the update....And i also i havent filled any visa application form i have only signed and sent my offer letter...Is that enough for visa processing becuase the consultancy did not ask much only my certificates softcopy they took.....Is that ok for processing?
Q3067_C4	should be that's all they took for me, you may need some verification of the certificates by the embassy here to confirm they haven't been forged. You sponsor needs to apply for a visa for a certain position and nationality before you can get your work permit, so they will have that and your quals and nationality should match.
Q3067_C5	you dont need to sign any you dont need to sign any visa application form.
Q3067_C6	Thanks Hi thanks for the update both of you...One more small clarification how many days will it take for the PDF visa to be processed????

Q3069	Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Hi,  We were lookig for a dog/puppy for our family and that is when we came to see Europuppy in the internet. I would like to know if anyone in Qatar have tried to buy from Europuppy. Is it safe to purchase a pet online? What about the safety of the animal? The prices they have mentioned seem to be reasonable. Please do reply, if anyone have had a satisfied experience from Europuppy.
Q3069_C1	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Why don't you come down to QAWS and have a look at all the abandoned and homeless animals that need a home instead of buying one from another country. There are far too many dogs and puppies in Qatar that need a good home.  Please be advised that if you do get a dog online, you have to be careful as you might not get the dog you ask for, it may be sick and you have no idea of the temperment.  There isn't anywhere that can guarentee the reputation of Europuppy as it is an internet based shop. They do not breed the puppies but find them around Europe so you don't know how they've been kept and how the mothers are treated. You also won't be able to get a puppy under the age of 16 weeks as it is illegal to import a puppy younger then that into Qatar.
Q3069_C2	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Chelsea, i am looking forward to go to QAWS this weekend with my family. I am just checking for an option incase I dont get a small breed. Because I had viewed the qaws site and dogs in doha site, all had medium to large dogs(I love big dogs, have two GSDs in my hometown but space prblms as discussed b4). I am not yet taking a decision, but checking out my options. I just want to know how trustworthy it can be, bcos the prices are too low which gives a doubt and just curious to know if someone from Qatar has actually tried it out.
Q3069_C3	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? I always thought that europuppy is maybe a puppy mill because you only get to contact one guy and he'll get the dog for you and puppy mills dogs will only be sick and costing you more then what you paid for! and not to mention encouraging his business  you should adopt a dog from qaws they usually have small breed dogs every now and then and speaking of which! I just found a small breed dog couple of hours ago but I really needs to search for the owner before giving him away!!
Q3069_C4	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? I have purchased my dog from europuppy.  They are safe to deal with.  Doha vets have dealt with them many times for importing dogs.
Q3069_C5	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? On-line long-distance pet offers are quite often scams. They will claim the puppy is a very low price or even free and then will charge you up-front for shipping and guess what -  no dog!
Q3069_C6	RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Be very careful about buying animals unseen.  Far better to buy from a breeder known to a trusted friend who can see the animal for you. Puppies, especially those from puppy farms, are very stressed by transport and liable to succumb to various illnesses such as parvovirus if not fully and correctly vaccinated.  I do not know Europuppy but I have heard too many sad stories of sick and dying imported animals.  Check with the local vets and welfare people to see whether they can make any recommendations.  Also, do not forget that there are various conditions applied for the transport of animals by air and for import to Qatar.

Q3074_C1	Better check with the traffic Better check with the traffic police( Better meet the captain). You may get the car into Qatar but it might not registered for road usage in Qatar.   Don't quote me on this.

Q3074_C4	Importing Cars Hi, pay attention to importing, these are most likely scams, usual blather about moving, money wrong side of the road..............if its too good to be true, generally it isnt, best of luck D
Q3074_C5	Thanks syed and Daniel. Thanks syed and Daniel. Exactly same wordings /she used in her post.
Q3074_C6	It's a scam Avoid this, there are at least two ads in QL for cars like this, for the fun of it I kept emailing the guy who uses a Western Expat name, when he said the car is not registered in Cyprus I.e. has no title I knew it was a scam. Also their insistence on using the shipping company was another tell, I've brought cars from the US before and the process is straight forward, but unless you have the title then good luck. Be careful people...

Q3077	Certificate attestation Hi.. Can any one tell me which agency is doing Certificate attestation.. in my company thet are asking for attesed college certificate
Q3077_C1	usually done by your embassy?  you need to prove that your certificate is real, not fake.  So i think your embassy has to approve it.
Q3077_C2	Umm Presumably you're Indian. The Indian Cultural Centre will do that for you as well, if you're worried about the long queues at the Indian Embassy.
Q3077_C3	Oh But it depends upon if you've got it notarized and attested in India already. Only then will the ICC do it here. They will get the CID approval as well. You will only need to go to the MOFA, which is behind Al Bustan hotel and get it attested.
Q3077_C4	never heard of any company never heard of any company demanding for attested documents !
Q3078	Mubarak's faith in Egyptian healthcare... If the president of a country has to be treated for  gallstone removal (not that difficult) in another another country (Germany), this does not say much for  Egyptian healthcare or does it instill a great amount of confidence in your own countrys ability to perform such procedures. What does this have to say about Egyptian trained providers? Mubarak himself shows the way to go -  EVASIVE ACTION !

Q3080	from hairdresser to secretary is anyone here knows if it is possible to change my visa and company from being hairdresser to secretary? i am planning to buy my NOC from my present company and planning to move to a new and more decent job which is secretary but i heard that it is not possible to change my profession, is it true? please help me
Q3080_C1	You can BUY an NOC? You can BUY an NOC?
Q3080_C2	The position stated in your visa is based on the availability of visa allowance given to your current sponsor/employer by the Ministry.   You are planning to buy your contract from your sponsor so they could give you the NOC AND LOOK FOR a secretarial job?   Your job must be paying so well...
Q3080_C3	buying any documents is buying any documents is illegal. If your current sponsor is willing to provide a NOC, you can cancel your RP, exit Qatar, and come back on the new work visa with the new job title, provided by the new sponsor.
Q3080_C4	Certainly yes When we have housewives through the influence of their husbands or others working as customer service representatives, sales representatives, etc in banks, companies,Malls and others then I dont see why you cannot change your profession provided your sponsor gives you a NOC (and thats what we call the magic document)

Q3082_C1	RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require yeah, it was a problem for me too, until last summer when i went back home for vacation. I brought from there some stuff  for my kitty, all for $1 :) I would love to share it with you, but some of them were given away right upon my arrival back in Doha, some of them got lost, some of them are not in a good condition. Currently my Cookie is playing with the Christmas tree balls, and she is sooo happy with them! She has emptied half of my Christmas tree (helped me to unload it for packing till the next Christmas), all the bottom of the tree is balls-free.. you can find balls everywhere: in the kitchen, under the bed, behind the couches, in my shoes.. she loves rolling them all over..

Q3082_C4	RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Hemal...

Q3082_C5	RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Please DO NOT leave your kitten alone with any toys that have string on them and never give them toys that are small enough to fit in their mouths.  The best cheap toys for kittens are:  Ping Pong Balls (QR15 for 30 at Carrefour) Empty Toilet Roll Tubes Balls of Tin Foil Childrens Wind Up Toys (they love to chase them!!) Laser Beeem (bee shaped laser pen cat toy QR30 from ShopRite) Socks

Q3083_C2	RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? I think the best one is the one that comes when u call 999....
Q3083_C3	RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? sorry... but if you are asking for a private ambulance... to compare with....   only one ambulance will come to you incase of any trouble. only hamad hosp ambulance, they have a complete equipment to take of you. ... there is also qatar red crescent. who works not for 24/7 duty. but they will be available in some events.... like sports event.... and of course they are visible in sealine resort every weekend.  ... some other clinic or hospital has a ambulance but they don't cater a call from 999. if i'm not mistaken... only for a private calls.  good luck

Q3083_C7	RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? I guess, there are private ambulances with American Hospital, Doha Clinic Hospitals etc...but i dont think any can reach you as fast as HMC's. Moreover, i doubt, no other ambulances are allowed to run thur the red traffic light other than HMCs ambulance. Emergency number is 999
Q3083_C8	RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? ....well just for your info. if qatar red crescent has a priority patient. they can run thru the red light also. but that is case to case basis. ... qatar red crescent ambulance are a big help for the hamad hosp., but if a house to hospital patient.... i guess the HMC will be the right to call.  good luck

The new law (No. 4 of 2009) regulating the entry, exit, residence and sponsorship of foreigners was ratified by the Heir Apparent H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and will be enforced with immediate effect.   Qatari women married to foreigners will be allowed to sponsor their husbands and children.   ...........
Q3093_C5	RE: Can a Foreigner  (Muslim)  marry Qatari Woman ? Non-muslim men  cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty, this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children, that's why u get married, in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing, the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult! proceed carefully!

Q3102_C5	I bought some labels at the I bought some labels at the bookstore near the Burger King R/A but not the Avery's one. It was my first time there and they have few selection of things, I was kind of in a rush when I went there but will try to come back again and see what exactly they have.
Q3102_C6	I was there on Wednesday as well, DavidJM The selection is actually pretty good.  I was looking at the labels that are 10 to a sheet - large enough for decent nametags.  I can't remember what the per-sheet price was, but the entire box (1000 labels total) was either 45QR or 55QR.    Assuming I have all the numbers right - and assuming that they work in a printer as well as the name-brand labels, that makes them significantly less expensive than even the Office Max brand labels in the U.S.  I think I'll give them a try!
Q3102_C7	Avery Labels Breaking news! Avery Labels available at the small stationery shop beside Olympic Sports on Airport Road :o)  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"

Q3102_C9	Not the best selection in Not the best selection in the world, but there is a choice. Best of all, they have my favourite CD/DVD labels that cover the whole disc (tiny centre hole only) :o) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"
Q3102_C10	ok, thanks baldrick2dogs! ok, thanks baldrick2dogs!
Q3102_C11	pretty sure they're not here I haven't seen any Avery labels. . .and I've definitely looked.  Hopefully someone will have a better answer for you.    There is a bookstore near the Burger King R/A - the one that sells toys, dates, computers, office supplies along with a pathetic book selection - where you can find labels of different sizes that are sold by the sheet.  It could be worth a look, but don't expect to find a huge selection.  Sorry!
Q3102_C12	Many thanks will try to come Many thanks will try to come and have a look tomorrow...

Q3108	to re-gift or not? do you find it tacky or practical to recycle unused,unopened gifts and give them to other people?i would really love to know your opinions about this matter. thanks.
Q3108_C1	I am a proud regifter!! You just have to be savvy enough to not regift the thing to the person who gave it to you initially.  Sounds easy enough, but when you've been stashing things in your closet for 12 months, you kind of forget where and who they came from!  My theory is that it's better those gifts go to someone else who might actually use and appreciate them than to sit unused in my spare bedroom for months on end.  And my friends and I usually have a Chinese gift exchange around the holidays, and that's an absolutely perfect opportunity for everyone to get rid of those types of items.  And some folks walk away really loving the new item they picked up!  "Most plain girls are virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise." -- Maya Angelou
Q3108_C2	tacky. If you give it to tacky. If you give it to somebody who knows the person who gave it to you.
Q3108_C3	It's practical, but i do not It's practical, but i do not do that. I always keep in mind the thought that the giver had on giving the gift to me, and that alone makes the gift a treasure to me.  <I> Mind your own business, then you will see the joy coming into your life.
Q3108_C4	im quite sentimental..so i im quite sentimental..so i wouldnt give them away. i think its okay if you give them to people who matter to you and who really likes the object ure giving away as oppose to just giving them to just whoever or worse selling them out. ^^
Q3108_C5	well its ok to regift but imagine u re-gift  something to the same person who gifted it u . lol
Q3108_C6	lol. quite an interesting lol. quite an interesting thought..yeah coz he must like it coz he gave it to you.
Q3108_C7	some may find it practical, some may find it practical, but i put value on gifts that others give to me so i cant do that.. :) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Misc/Smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gif" title="MySpace Comments" border="0"></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingchees
Q3108_C8	yeah if its @stonecold yeah if its a bomb, well no you will not be in trouble..you'll just be dead!
Q3108_C9	If the package is still presentable... I re-gift specially those I already have. (like the 5 coffee makers we received as wedding gifts.... LOL!) If the package is broken, I just give it away to anyone who wants/needs it.

Q3115_C1	RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... First-It will not boost your horspower or acceleration anything considerable-if you where racing and a 1/100th of a second counted then ok.

Q3115_C2	RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... it will make a difference if you will change your header, and  full exhaust system. it's a landcruiser, why set it up? plus you might get rip off, k&n filters goes for around Qr250.I'm not into 4wd. if you want to set up a car, go for honda or 350Z!!!
Q3115_C3	RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... Agree with all the above - it's a bus for #$%& sake. The difference is negligable. Besides, with the dust in Qatar you are better off with the factory fitted filter which is designed for our conditions
Q3115_C4	RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... Bro, I agree with cdpascual initial performance gainer would be Intake/Header/Exhaust modifications. If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better, with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty.  Cheers,

If I renew now, I won't be able to travel in March as the renewal process takes about a month. I wish I could postpone but I can't.

Q3118_C3	RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? The service is OK. i am using it since it launched.. but the charges are high.. even though the shipment is less than a kilo then charge for 1.5 to 1.6 KG citing volumetric reasons.. this is bit unreasonable. i havent tried Aramex, but seems to be better than DHL. DHL is faster no doubt but be prepared to pay the price.... of not less than 130 QAR for any weight....
Q3118_C4	RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? DHL has faster transit time from US to Qatar. Rates from US to Qatar - first 0.5kg is QR 59 and each additional 0.5kg is QR 30. DHL Flexiship might be  good option for regular internet shoppers.

Q3127_C3	RE: Can you help.... If your child's front teeths came out and you want to fix braces to become the teeths in level, I think no dentist will prefer to fix it. Because your child is growing now and the shape of the face is not yet completed.So it is not good to fix braces in this gowing time.  It is very cosly here to fix braces. If your company provided insurance and the insurance company will cover this type of treatment then Okay. If you doing it in India, you have consult the dentist 2 to 3 times to tight the braces.  Anyway contact a good physician and ask advise.  Best regards

Q3129_C31	in this place, there are lots of surprising normal occurrence - it is normal to let children play inside a moving vehicle sans seat belts; few others leave them for "MOMENTS" (meaning - HOURS in this part of the world)locked, under the bright sunlight of about about 50+ degrees. - it is normal to turn left or right without lights indicator on; or using the right signal to turn left and things like that.  It is even normal to tailgate, use mobile phones at a NORMAL 100 KPH when the NORMAL posted LIMIT is 80.  Thus NORMALLY everyone seems to accept that it is NORMAL to ADD + 20 or more to the posted LIMIT; or drive half the speed limit when about 20 vehicles tailing with no one else in front . - It is normal to talk about issues of neighboring countries while being blind on issues just in front of us.  - it is NORMAL to tell everyone to choose to leave if you don't like the rules, though, you cannot leave as you have chosen when you tender your resignation. -  i wish i can rant some more , but i've normally, accepted these realities, as most people do.

So a lot of major supermarkets will pick up a piece of gum or chocolate and scan it, so that it adds to the bill and rounds it up to an even number.    Therefore the gum isn't change, but another item of your shopping.  I always just pay with a card these days, that way you only pay for what you want, and not a dirham more.

Q3143	Bringing Prescription Medicine To Qatar Dear friends,  Please tell me if I will face a problem if I am carrying my own personal prescription medicines with me to Qatar. I have the prescription of my Indian Doctor.  I would have to carry about 365 of those capsules for 1 year of stay in Doha.  I think they open and check all the bags at airport.  What about sending them by courier to Qatar with prescription? Is it allowed?  Thank you, Junaid
Q3143_C1	They are not opening each and They are not opening each and evey bag at the Airport. They will open only those bags which is suspicious of having something illegal. You can bring your medicines with the proof of purchase and the prescription from your doctor. There are many patients bringing their medicine for diabetes and blood pressure in hundreds.
Q3143_C2	As far as our experience As far as our experience goes, there is no problem as long as you have your prescription.  We have been here 4 1/2 yrs and have never been stopped and questioned at the airport.  You can send it by courier with the prescription but it goes to "Customs" for clearance. I don't see any problem with you carrying these meds.  Best regards  Dez
Q3143_C3	If you send it by courier, If you send it by courier, they may open and check and then put a 'customs checked' seal / tape on the package, since it's medicines.   If you bring it with you, they may check, depends on the type of medication, but if u have a prescription with you, it shouldn't be a problem.   Like others have stated here, many bring painkillers, diabetes, n hypertension drugs with them here.
Q3143_C4	Junaid If u bring it along with you, there wont be any problem, keep prescription and bill with you. But if u send it by courier then after customs checking it will go to HMC (White fort building) , then you have to go there with prescription and receipt and need to convince the Doctor in charge to collect the medicines. ( Last yr i collected some indian ayurvedic medicines same way which was couriered)
Q3143_C5	They don't open all bags at They don't open all bags at airport. Only if they find something suspicious they will open it. Medicines with doctor's prescription is not a problem. and as sanooj said if u send it by courier the medicines will be sent to HMC and then returned back after verification.

Q3166_C25	It depends upon the mood of It depends upon the mood of the person. I think it would be more appropriate to know from where this abaya came or its origin so that one can come to conclusion. Abaya, the black thobe, is not an Islamic order or must. The only cover Islam requires women to have is to wear something which covers the whole body from head to toe & the only thing should be visible is face, hands & feet. Second thing is the dress should not be revealing or body fitting, it should be something decent which should not give a hint about their figure nor it should be too loose which might attract others attention to make u a fun object. Third thing that should be taken care about is the dress should have modest colours & not shining & lots of art work which would attract opposite gender.   Now coming to abaya, no where in Islam it is mentioned, neither is Quran nor in Ahadees (Sayings of Holy Prophet PBUH). Abaya is something cultural, sometimes ladies are made to wear these so that they are not identified by hiding their faces too with Nakaabs (face veils). Majority of men make their women use face veils because they are in a culture where people make fun of families for not following cultural values, sometiems out of enimity if a woman of a certain family is identifiable they kidnap her or try to harass her only to degrade any particular family. Sometimes, it is simply the choice of woman who feels comfortable in wearing abaya only because if she comes out in normal islamic dress, she'll have several stares from other women, forget about men at this stage. So instead of answering everyone why she is not following cultural values / dresses she prefers to make their mouth shut by being one of them. Sometimes its too humid outside & if the lady wants to follow her islamic dressing too she might wear something short inside & on it she can wear a loose abaya, thus giving her comfort + no sense of guilt. So there  are several possibilities that come with abaya thing.   My own thinking is that abaya is a full dress, its something like a man wearing shalwar kameez, or a woman wearing skirt shirt or an arabic man wearing white thobe so there is no need to wear additional dress to it. Briefs or vests are okay to make urself comfortable but wearing a skirt shirt then wearing a abaya for a corniche walk that goes beyond my mind. But yes, if you are working in a woman only environment & as humans like to show off what new dress or shoes do they have, they remove their abayas in there & move along with whatever decent they are wearing.   Looks like I have written something boring so better to finish it off here :)  Cheers :)   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++        CONFUSE ............ if you cannot convince! <a href="http://www.glitterfy.com/"><img src="http://img34.glitterfy.com/342/glitterfy063341T565F.gif" alt="Glitter Words" border=0 /></a><br /><

Q3166_C32	FS... if he is new to the Middle East...then yes, I do think he has no clue..its so foreign to western culture that it sparks curiosity.

Q3166_C33	When I first got to Qatar I had no idea what women wore under their abayas.  Then as I got to meet more local women, I figured out it was just normal everyday clothes.  Imagine my surprise when I attended my first Qatari wedding and saw all the abayas falling off to reveal these va-va-va-VOOM dresses that shocked even me, and would have made the flashbulbs go off on any red carpet in Hollywood.  My jaw was on the floor -- couldn't have imagined they would be wearing THOSE kinds of dresses on underneath. So appearances can often be deceiving...  ;-)

Q3188	Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives) damage the car paint? Hi all,  I am planning for a road trip to dubai from doha next week. I saw in some posts that If I use the sand like spray, i have to polish the car to remove it. Some said using dish washing liquid is the cheap and best option. Does the dish washing liquid damage the car paint? My car color is black, so I am a bit concerned.
Q3188_C1	RE: Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives)... I have used the sand like spray,... it does not need polish to be removed. It comes off just by water. And car paint is not effected. Not sure how safe the washing liquid is on the car paint. I think people use it because its cheaper than the sand spray.

Q3193	Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT VISA ? I was working in a Qatari Company for 2 years I had to go to my Country and for some reasons my Resident VISA Got expired.  I have come again on the same Company on VISIT VISA and for last 06 months, I am working.  My salary has been transferred to same OLD Bank Account. Can I apply for SCHENGEN VISA and How ?
Q3193_C1	RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... You are only a visitor and not a resident. Check with French Embassy.
Q3193_C2	RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... nope you cannot..you should be a resident here and stayed at least 6 months on your current RP..check with Italian embassy which is easier for Schengen visa as per my experience.
Q3193_C3	RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... If you are on a VISIT VISA you CANNOT apply for any foreign Visa from here. YOU HAVE to have an RP as your sponsor will have to vouch for you.
Q3193_C4	RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... you can Apply for a Visa, Even if you are on Visit Visa, Just get a NOC letter from your Company...   Saudi Visas's are issued even if a Person is on a Visit Visa, provided he Submits a NOC.   Even Other GCC Countries, Except US, and UK.....   One of my Friends wife even got a 1 year Multiple Visa for Malaysia on Family Visit Visa, In a Day.... :)
Q3193_C5	RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... Italian Embassy is the worst at handing out Schengen visas. It took me 3 months with lots of hassle to get mine.  I hear the French Embassy is way easier, will be going through them next time.
Q3194	Without Exit Visa!!! Hello everybody...  Good Day!  I just want to ask if it is possible to work there in QATAR without cancelling my work visa here in Bahrain, because my employer refused to cancel my working visa here in bahrain. Is there any other option? pls. help me guys.. May God Bless you all..Thank you so much
Q3194_C1	RE: Without Exit Visa!!! I don't know if anything can be done from here since the cancellation of your visa must be done at the Bahrain airport, not here in Doha.   If your visa is expiring anytime soon, say within the next two to three months, I'm not sure either if your residence permit in Doha would be processed if your Bahrain visa has not been cancelled but has expired.  Let's wait for some additional info from other QLers.
Q3194_C2	RE: Without Exit Visa!!! Welcome to Qatar with a new passport if your employer is not cancelling the Visa due to some reasons.
Q3194_C3	RE: Without Exit Visa!!! As the guy above said, get a new passport, no problems then!!
Q3195	Does Anyone Homeschool? I have been homeschooling my daughter for over 3 years since the start of her education and have no desire to send her to a public institution regardless of how highly rated it might be.  Does anyone know firsthand if there are any regulations regarding this?  We will be moving to Doha after Ramadan, I have asked my husband about this but he can't seem to find the answers.

Q3198	Al-Gharrafa  area, whats it like? Hi, I am moving to Qatar in the next couple of weeks and we will be living in Al-Gharrafa. What's this area like? I also have a 6 year old boy so any schools near this area? Thanks in anticipation
Q3198_C1	re:Moving to Al Gharrafa Welcome to Qatar Gharrafa is a nice quite area and is ideal for families. There is a good shopping centre named Lulu in the area. They are a few schools like Qatar Canadian school and  Compass International School but trust me it is hard to get into. Most schools have a waiting list. This by far will be your biggest challenge. Keep me posted and I will try to help you out. Good luck!!
Q3198_C2	Al Gharafa is fine - for the Al Gharafa is fine - for the most part no section of Doha is that much better or worse than any other.  Unlike some other cities in the world, the expats are not concentrated in particular areas - so anywhere you land will be fine.  As for schools, Compass is right there in Al Gharafa and is the school that my 5yo son attends.  Sherbourne isn't too bad of a run from Al Gharafa (I don't think it is, anyway).  Like ominstructor said, getting into a school is going to be your biggest challenge.  Good luck!
Q3198_C3	Thanks Thanks for the info thats very useful. I know finding a school for my son will be very challenging. compass is a very expensive school!!!  Any ideas about the Gulf English School, there website is not updated since last year and tried to email them but the email bounced back. also tried to phone from the UK and was on hold for a long time and had to give up at the end. Thanks
Q3198_C4	I have a friend whose kids I have a friend whose kids are at the Gulf English School.  I'm sure she'd be willing to give you her feedback - PM me or send me an email (I think I sent it to you) if you want to touch base with her.
Q3198_C5	Thanks that would be great, whats your email?
Q3199	entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 (11+) stage.  Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her?  Any advice gratefully received!
Q3199_C1	Entrance exams You really do need to say which school or schools she will be trying to get into. For some schools, the most important requirements are a British passport and loads and loads of cash to pay the extortionate school fees.
Q3199_C2	This seems to be the strange This seems to be the strange thing.  How important is the entrance test? Or is it as you say a British passport and cash gets them in.  We have visited the schools that follow the british and international curriculum - on the whole most have been very helpful and friendly - but one in particular (the name of our city is in its name) was particularly unhelpful and cold towards us.  Some schools have said a formal test on Math, English and some science - others have said multiple choice - I don't know if my daughter is at the right stage or if she needs to do some extra work - and if so what work - if anyone has any information on the exams - I would very much appreciate some guidance - it is beginning to worry me - or am I worrying unecessarily and just the passport and money will get her a place!?
Q3199_C3	They're trying to weed out They're trying to weed out those students with Special Educational Needs and they're also checking on their standard of English (which shouldn't be a problem for a native speaker).
Q3199_C4	Worrying about a School Place My old sparring partner Squarepeg is quite right, of course. A lot of schools in Doha have little or no provision for SEN children and there is not much in the way of EAL support either. Trying to get the students through a curriculum that is in their second language is no easy task, so of course many schools would prefer to have more students for whom English is their "mother tongue".   If a school has a significant proportion of Qatari students, then of course the Supreme and Absolutely Perfect Education Council of Qatar will want to make sure that the little darlings are getting lots and lots of lessons in Arabic and Islamic Studies. (That's a fat lot of use if your family are not Muslims and and you speak English as your first language.) Learning Arabic may sound like a fun thing for your child to do, but it isn't because the Arabic teachers follow the Supreme and Immaculate Education Council's orders and therefore they teach it in a really dull and useless way, instead of concentrating on conversational Arabic that could be useful and enjoyable. As for Islamic Studies, the teachers (who are usually Egyptians or Lebanese) do not want to lose their jobs and so they let the students see the exam papers before the actual exams, so that they can memorise all of the answers. Then the students get amazingly high marks and everyone is happy.
Q3199_C5	Which school does your Which school does your daughter currently attend.  The teachers may be able to help you.
Q3199_C6	To keep the forum on To keep the forum on track... you are from the UK so I wouldnt worry in the least about the entrance exams. These exams are general knowledge tests which determine what level she is at and her english abilities.   As for Islamic and arabic studies, they arent mandatory at a lot of international school (only in some instances are arabic lessons mandatory but certainly not Quran).  ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q3199_C7	"Aren't mandatory" Amoud has kindly suggested that Islamic Studies and Arabic are not mandatory at some schools in Qatar. He (or she) may well be right. The bad news, however, is that long waiting lists and lack of places ARE mandatory, it would appear, at all of the better schools in Doha. (These are usually the ones that do not have lots of Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum.) Yes, a British passport does indeed come in handy, but so does a very big pile of cash. The better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so (surprise, surprise) they put up their fees accordingly.    I have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning Arabic. I do, however, get very annoyed with the way that the Completely Wonderful Education Council insists that expat children should be taught Arabic in a way that is totally boring, lifeless and insipid. When I was teaching in Doha, several expat parents told me that they were happy for their children to learn Arabic, but they wanted them to learn conversational Arabic that the children could actually use. When I quizzed the teachers, they said that the Utterly Amazing Education Council laid down the law about how Arabic should be taught, so it is just another example of the Totally Magnificent Education Council screwing things up.  Great to hear from you again, Squarepeg. I am now teaching at a school in the UAE, but I thought that it might be fun to have a look at Qatar Living, for old times' sake.
Q3199_C8	Hippo, what you are telling Hippo, what you are telling her has absolutely nothing to do with what she is asking, and to be honest a british passport does nothing for her if she is applying to a non-British school and then may not have much weight if the school does not have a policy of allowing entrance to it nationals first.   Also, the huge pile of cash is baloney as well. If you have the money to pay the fees, or the company pays thats sufficient.   The exams are also for the 2010 start, which she will have sufficient time for climbing the waiting list. It isn't as cynical as you make it seem, and I may add that the Qatar canadian school is governered by the Ministry of Education and offers neither arabic nor Quran at this point, but do offer french as it is the second language of Canada.   _____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q3199_C9	Amoud, what you are telling... Amoud, what you are suggesting to everyone (not just the original person who first posted the question) is that the school fees at most (or all) schools in Qatar are very reasonable. Or maybe you are saying that if the school fees are a bit high, then it is not a problem at all because your company will always pay. Many parents are not in this happy situation, Amoud, and sometimes there is a BIG gap between what your company is prepared to pay and what the school expects you to pay.  Your comment about "climbing the waiting list" assumes that you have in fact been given a place on the waiting list. If you bother to look back at previous postings on Qatar Living, you will find that plenty of parents have been told that the waiting list is full for the school of their choice, so how can they "climb" the waiting list?  Just in case you have not noticed, Amoud, again and again on this forum there have been postings about which schools in Doha are the best. Compass, DESS, Park House and Doha College have frequently been mentioned by parents as being some of the best schools in Doha. Guess what? They are all British schools and a British passport, though not compulsory, is highly desirable if you want your child to go to one of these schools. The American School also has rave reviews and (surprise, surprise) the fees are probably the highest in Doha. Hence my comment about piles of cash coming in handy.
Q3199_C10	Again Hippo, has absolutely Again Hippo, has absolutely nothing to do with what the poster is asking. I am sure she is aware of the school fees if she is sitting for an exam for 2010.   The rest is nonesense as well. I have been here 10 plus years and my children have been given places in more than half of the schools you mention and we dont have British passports nor is our school funding coming from our company.   People who complain about not having a spot in school are the ones who wait until the last minute to register. She is registering for September 2010. If I do recall it is now November 2009, more than 10 months in advance.....  ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q3199_C11	School waiting lists "Please help. We are trying to move out to Doha from the UK this October, but are coming up against a brick wall with school places. Every school seems to be full with waiting lists. How on earth do you get your kids in to schools, especially those teaching Engliush curriculum. It seems to be impossible?"   I just came across this new posting today, Amoud, and it does seem to suggest that getting a school place for your child is not as easy as you suggest.   I am not an economist, but I do believe that there is something called, "The Law of Supply and Demand". If there is a shortage of something, the price goes up. This is what has happened (and continues to happen) in many schools in Doha, especially the British schools I have already mentioned.
Q3200	Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hi Has anybody heard of any changes to the tourist visa rules,believe u cannot avail the same anymore from the immigration at the Airport and have to be done only thru the hotels.
Q3200_C1	RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes so what happens if you have friends coming to visit and stay with you?  They HAVE to stay in a Hotel?
Q3200_C2	RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hey if this is true,Hotels are going to hike up the already very high rates and make a bounty at the cost of residents who want to get their relatives over here for few days,fail to understand we want to compete with UAE in all other matters but in this case we go in the opposite direction,this is not fair MOI is not helping residents but the hotels to do business at the cost of residents.
Q3200_C3	RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes Tourist Visa headache. I went down to the building opposite the airport the other day to try and get a visa for the mrs. As i walked in I was surprised to find that there were only two people in there. When I went there in June the place was balls to the wall with bodies. Anyhow, I politely went up to the females who sit and process the visas, the freindly lady sent me over to the opposite desk to the not so friendly official who is suppost to stamp your form and check your documents. Now when i walked in the building this guy was obviously on the dog big time however, when I came walking over he was suddenly overcome with work and far too busy to be arsed with the likes of some expat who's looking to bring more expats in the country. So he looks at me with distain that would topple a camel and tells me the form that I've just 2 hours ago downloaded from the net is no longer valid and they've changed the rules. Obviously i should have known this information, he was somehow bemused that my world didn't revolve around the ever changing Qatar visa system and the fact that i didn't know the changes that had been implemented only last week he could not comprehend. He then bamboozled me with some number and name of a travel agent of the name he said so fast it sounded and i actually wrote down Quarabatra travel, it was only later after i repeated this to the woman at the end of the qtel directory enquiries that i found out he was actually saying Cleopatra Travel?? This company were even less helpful than the visa official. bottom line, if you want a visa you'll have to get one through the hotels but there is always a loop hole and being a Brit we always find em.. The hotel will get you a 30 day visa so if like me you want your tourist to stay at your place just get the hotel for a night. also that way the hotel gets to clean your bed sheets after you haven't seen the mrs for 2 months, its going to get sweaty.  Cheapest hotel i found was the Intercontinental QR1000 +19% bulls**t charge
Q3200_C4	RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes if true, good news. reduce some ques. he actual need will go to hotel.

Q3202	Resident visa Hi All.  I will travel to Qatar in a month fro Europe in order to join a company. How long does it take a resident visa to be issued? Can someone rent accommodation without a resident visa? If not whare can he live?   Thanks
Q3202_C1	If the company you are If the company you are starting work with is in any way decent, they should have temporary accommodations for you waiting for your RP to be processed. If not think twice before coming over here. It may be an indication of how they treat their staff.
Q3202_C2	Answer to the Point.... It may take 2 to 3 months for visa to be issued. No rent without visa. You can stay in a Hotel or of course company arranged accomodation. Good Luck and welcome to Qatar.
Q3202_C3	Better to check first your Better to check first your accomodation before travelling to Doha. If your accomodation allowance is included in your salary package then you will stay in the hotel on your arrival hence you cannot rent till you got the Residence Permit and this is required also for the application of your bank personal cheque to support the monthly rental.

Q3205	Work Visa and RP I am an American with a job waiting in Qatar. I have been told Qatar is not giving any Americans work visas currently. Is this true? Can I expect Qatar to give visa and RP at some future point?       Thank You
Q3205_C1	RE: Work Visa and RP Don't believe every rumor you hear. Why would the State of Qatar stop issuing work visas to Americans? If you are qualified for the job and your experience and skills would certainly contribute in the country's continued development, then Qatar would surely be glad to have you here.

If you will not renew till the expiry date, it has one month grace period also.

Q3221	health fitness center (gym) can anyone give me a good heath and fitness (gym) location situated in an around lulu hypermarket or al hilal or mamoura area.
Q3221_C1	RE: health fitness center (gym) I'd stay away from fitness first. It's a purely about making money, more so than any business.  While you are waiting inline for people to finish using equipment, you will see new people being given the tour of the place, when it is obviously over crowded already.  What's fitness first's answer? Come when it's not so crowded. HAHA. A Gym that wants YOU to work to THEIR timings.  Other than that, they have a lot of anti consumer policies, you cant cancel unless they take another month out of your credit card, they etll you you get a passport to use anywhere (but in reality you have to *apply* for it, and it's only for 30 days).  Just drop by & see how they try to muscle you into taking the 1 year package no matter how much you tell them that you'll only be here for 6 months. Don't believe the transferable stuff because the responsibility is completely on you to find someone to transfer it to.  Also, parking in city center is hell. I could go on & on & on like how pretty much everyone there is paying a different rate for the exact same thing.  I'd look for a good gym in a hotel. Make sure you go to these places on the same time/day of the week you plan on going to get a real

Q3226	can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family to visit me here? I have an RP now, and am getting conflicting answers from my company. So far they have said that they can pay for a visa on entry, then they said that they need a family visit visa - so which is it? They are only staying for about 10 days.
Q3226_C1	RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... Conflicting answers my result from confusion about which nationalities you are inquiring about. You need to specify their countries of passport.
Q3226_C2	RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... From your profile, I understand you are British. I assume your family members coming here have British passports.  If this is true, then let them come and they will get the visit visas from the airport directly stamped onto their passports. Each visa will cost 100 QR per passport and is valid for one month only. REMEMBER TO TELL THEM TO BRING A VALID CREDIT CARD AS IT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN PAY FOR THE VISAS IN THE AIRPORT!  If you wish to have them a resident permit (to stay here with you for more than that period) then you have to apply for  resident visas, which you can simply do after they arrive, if you wish.  Don't worry, they will have no problems at all in entering.

Q3226_C4	RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... The last stateement about needing a credit card to pay for the visa at the airport is not true. I came here for a month in march and paid by cash then moved here in june, again paid by cash. Not everyone has a credit card! You can also renew the visa after one month for another month costing the same 100QR.  Good luck and hope your family enjoy the stay.
Q3226_C5	RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... Dancing Queen,  If you say you did it without credit card, then this is new to me.  When I entered Qatar last year for the very first time, I offered cash and they refused any payment unless it was made by a credit card.  At the passport authorities, when I applied for my wife's visa, they also insisted on paying with a credit card. They even had machines that produced disposable credit cards for the value of the fee that were used once if the applicant did not own a credit card.

Q3228	diamond earrings or gold earrings??? hi guys!    I am planning to buy a piece of jewelry, but i want to know which is better for investment.. gold or diamond earrings?thank you for your inputs!!
Q3228_C1	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? The best investment is yellow or white gold because they are having a very good resale value. Diamond is not having a good resale value, every year its value decreases by some good percent. So better to buy gold and best shop is Damas which u can find at many places in Doha. Hope this can help u out :).
Q3228_C2	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Diamond , don't have any resale value,  Go for old whatever it is??????????  Best of luck.
Q3228_C3	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Have you not heard the statements like " Diamonds are forever " and " A Diamond is a girls best friend " ?  Well diamonds are forever since, when you buy a diamond, you have to keep it forever , as its value reduces in an exponential manner and it makes no sense in selling it at 10 % of its price.  Secondly how do you know that the gold that you are buying is pure ? Back home they may just refuse to buy it back or ask for a 8 % discount on listed price.  Besides Gold will soon drop to about 800 $ per ounce in the comming months, so why buy at all ?  I sincerely feel that Silver has to do a lot of catching up so would buy Silver bricks if possible , I feel it will give better returns than Gold in the 10-12 month horizon !!  Cheers to you while you make the decision.  If you are buying as an ornament go for gold-- If you are buying as in investment -- go for Silver.
Q3228_C4	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Go for jewelry that is yellow gold and without gems nor stones. White gold is nice, but it has a cheaper market value than the yellow gold.
Q3228_C5	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? of course gold..
Q3228_C6	RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? For investment, both are OK if you invest like this.  Gold - Buy gold block from the famous shop with certificate.  Diamond - Buy loose good color (E), clarity (VVS1)and Carat (0.5 - 0.7) with certificate. Don't buy one carat diamond which is double price.  If you want to have good return, you have to invest quality one. Good luck in investment.
