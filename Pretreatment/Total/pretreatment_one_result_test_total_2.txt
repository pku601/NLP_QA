voda simcard each time im checking my balance with voda...there is a last message such as you have 30 minutes free call...but i dont know how i can use it...can someone tell me is it true or what...if true how i can use it..because each time im reloading it is adding and adding more minutes..from 30 minutes its now coming more than an hour free minutes...
hey come on... r u serious, didnt anyone tell you about the free vodafone minutes on every recharge. if not, then check on www.vodafone.com.qa, these are the vodafone free minutes, which you can use to call other vodafone nos for free. :-)
I have the same Problim , I have the same Problim , all i know they do not have vodaphone phone and still adding minutes ,and i will loose it if not used .
Very sad!! At first voda phone is heda phone. if you try to call international, you should try more then 30 time.       frns,it is 100% true. if you have free calls and you don't know where & how to use, give me i will use. because i know the......     you should know by your self. cause ,it is very simple to know.
i differ I am vodafone customer who was mad at your state earlier. then lately found out, if you try calling asian countries in the evening you wont get through, when i tried during noon its smooth. and for europe and US its always open. so then i started appreciating the vodafone offer for 50 DH international call, there must be some compromise atleast.... so lets live with it. and happy to hold one.
which bank gives the best car loan? I am in a verge of making a decision whether I should get a car loan or just lease a car.   If I decide to get a loan from the bank. Which bank gives the best customer service and lowest interest rate.  If you know a car I can buy. Thats superb!!!!
all the banks pretty much all the banks pretty much charge the same rates... the differentiating factor is only the service element... from personal experiences..commercialbank seems to be the best... i highly reccomend them.   J.J
I will give 'em wow! thanks!  I will give 'em a ring anytime tomorrow to check that out...
why dont you just ask your bank we're your salary is, it is easier that way. most banks now offer 4.5% ineterest on car loan. go to any car dealer you prefer, they will give you full details. Got mine from Doha Bank.  "katas ng qatar"
yeah! I would love yeah! I would love to...  What car are we talking about here and the price coz I have noticed that Doha isnt a very big city and I will only use it to drive to work and grocery and night outs during the weekend. So I dont mind going for a not so expensive but good car...if second hand should be handled carefully and wont be having any car wrecks in the future  pls give me his number

RE: Does anyone know if Sinutab is available here? Yeah its right next to the Nyquil. Seriously try claritine instead. Mat need a prescription here though.
RE: Does anyone know if Sinutab is available here? Im using also sinutab but you cannot find sinutab here try to use the panadol for sinus. It really works based from im experience.
RE: Does anyone know if Sinutab is available here? You can try Panadol Sinus tablets.  They seem to be the closest to Sinutab here. If you are still battling, you can also try Vibrosil Nasal Spray.  Both have helped me.  Good luck.

Fire safety legislation in Qatar daycares Hi folks,  I am going to inspect my son's daycare tomorrow in regards to fire safety practices that are (or are not) employed on site. I want to know what the law states as what are minimum requirements, such as a sprinkler system, fire drills and fire exits.  I have had a look through MOI and defense websites, but can't seem to find what I'm looking for. Any advice on this would be much appreciated.  Cheers,  KIQ
I think many parents may be I think many parents may be doing this in the coming weeks kiwi....the authorities need to take a good hard look at themselves and the slack practices currently in place...but for now the time is for grieving and mourning.
excuse me for being naive excuse me for being naive Mandi,  but are u serious or joking? i mean, no kidding, i don't want to end up showered in powder or water, with alarm going on and fire brigade comming over. can i do like u said or ur joking?
This is best done by a This is best done by a certification agency, with people holding expertise in the subject. The MoI need to qualify a list of such agencies and pay them generously to establish branches here in Qatar.  Permission renewal cannot be issued without such certificate on annual basis.
No joke drsam, that is a test No joke drsam, that is a test button in the smoke alarm.  Do not touch the sprinklers if you have them.
No, it's not a joke, habibi! No, it's not a joke, habibi! If you are talking about the kitchen in your house you just have a self-contained smoke detector, not a sprinkler system. A white plastic round object? There is a test button. There may also be a little green light.  If you have a nozzle leading to a pipe that might be a sprinkler system. Sprinkler systems are heat-activated, not smoke sensitive. So don't worry about pushing a button on a white plastic box. It's not hard-wired into the emergency response system. It's just there to wake you up and get you out of the house in case of smoke. Mandi
translator, thks; the translator and mandi, thks; the "ear-splitting shriek" will turn off automatically after a minute or two, or do i have to turn it off somehow?
In most buildings these are In most buildings these are not smoke detectors (smoke being the primary cause of death in fire situations) they are heat detectors and are therefore mostly useless.  Most people I know who are interested/cognizant of real fire safety have brought smoke detectors from their home countries and installed them in their homes/flats.  Heat detectors are of little to no use - especially if you are asleep when the fire starts.  Smoke detectors are easy to test, just burn a piece of toast in the same or nearby room.  The smoke will set it off.
drsam and others--it's easy drsam and others--it's easy enough to buy your own, if you are unsure of the ones provided.  Change the batteries every year.  When we moved to Qatar I bought a simple battery one for each room--worth every penny.
drsam:it depends also on drsam:it depends also on whether it is stand alone smoke detector or it is connected through wires to main fire panel which is normally located centrally in building entrance or guard house. Wired type smoke detectors r normally tested using smoke spray (Brand name:Solo etc). Installation of fire alarm system requires routine preventive maintenance and calibration of detection devices; usually done by qualified technicians.
heat detectors heat detectors are used in areas prone to dust or smoke in normal condition like kitchen, ware houses, washrooms(due to exhaust fan), parking floors etc, smoke detector in this situation leads to more false alarms
maintenance for Ac's Please also do periodic maintenance for AC;specially during the hot season, the compressor withdraws extra current to so as to reach the cooling setpoint; this results extra current flowing than normal & eventually spark.
So does anyone have info on So does anyone have info on fire-safety laws relating to childcare facilities in Qatar?  Some good points here though. Raven, I agree, now is the time is for grieving and mourning. However, I still have to drop my toddler off tomorrow at a daycare that may or may not be unsafe. My kids are my first priority and I will do what I have to do as soon as I can, not in the coming weeks. Drsam. Don't be scared of your smoke alarm. It won't bite.......very hard. Good point about the A/C Aijaz, our electricity is dodgy anyway. Lights blow out every day, come on and off on their own accord.
alarms for sprinkler systems, I would suggest a joint drill by the house owners and the occupants, and in the case of a school or day care center, it is best decided with cooperation between the parents and the school authorities.   The test is simple, a hydrotest is all that is required to check the pressure and the coverage area of each sprinkler.  Refer to this link for your understanding, (note: this is not reality, its just basics)  http://www.archtoolbox.com/materials-systems/fire-supression/83-sprinklerspacing.html  so, from this link, we can say, the distance between the sprinkler heads A & B can be determined by the area covered by distance A (distance must have a minimum over lapse)  and for the fire alarms, usually, a light should be blinking on the FAS system. If there is no source of lighting indication, then these might be battery operated, and so checking would be simple. If battery operated, first open the battery case cover, light a lighter/candle for a few seconds, and as soon as the buzzer goes on, remove one of the batteries. That should prove that the FAS works.  If it is building controlled, consult with the building owner first before taking any drastic steps..  Maybe these helps...good luck with your inspection tomorrow!
Very informative, thank you Very informative, thank you ani_chy. I am not looking to take drastic steps. I just want to know what the laws are regarding fire-safety and if our daycare is conforming to these laws. For the price we are paying, I certainly hope so. If they are not, then my child will not be attending in the future, and I will be contacting the appropriate authorities.
too hard to find actually, i have been searching it myself for the past 1 hour...damn its hard to find!

requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? I am curious to find out if single working mothers are allowed to sponsor or hire nannies here in Qatar. Responses will be appreciated. Thanks!
RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? yea its easy just get your divorced certificate and your ID and go to the immigration office and they will let u know if they approve it or not within two weeks and u have to decide first which country u want the maid from
RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? If you working on a single status then I think it would be very difficult. As generally nannies/house maid are for families. You are stating single mom.. Now that beggers the question are you married or not. If you are not married then that might be another problem as you will be required to produce the marriage certificate at the immigration department..
RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? check out http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/channel/Residents/index.html  or  http://portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/homeEN?New_WCM_Context=/wps/wcm/connect/cnt/en/1_home/11_Citizens_and_Residents
RE: requirements for a single mom to sponsor a nanny? i think you should have no problem, but the papers you will require are a bit troublesome.... anyways, with the new requirements here are the papers you will need for the approval (ive been through this proceedure just a month ago).  1- your passport copy with a copy of your RP. 2- your child/childrens passport copy with a copy of their RPs. 3- Marraige/divorce Certificate. 4- Salary Certificate from your employer with date of employment. preferably certified from the housing department (but in that case you will need 2 copies of your salary certificate, as one copy stays with the housing dept) 5- Bank Account Statement from your bank, preferably stamped from the bank.  then you must type out the application form (you can type it out at the immigration office) identifying which nationality you will be employing.  then you go to building no. 4 to apply the application with the attached papers required. they give you a follow up slip that has the visa request number on it. you can track the application online at www.moi.gov.qa  if its approved then "Mabrook!" otherwise you have to go upstairs and talk to the manager and he should "approve" it for you after you tell him why you need the helper!  good luck! need any help let me know!

Don't be a snob qatari citizen Do you think you are superior to North Africans? As I said there are local women who teach Arabic.   And there are alternatives to people from the magreb teaching Arabic. Look at all the people here from Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt (although I wouldn't study Egyptian Arabic because every other Arab laughs at you).
for qatari citizen for ur information north africans are tunisian and moroccan and if u claim that  it is up to them ti teach arabic then u assert that they are arabs or how could they teach a language they do not speak! allow me to say that u r speaking out of ignorance! it is true we are not 100% pure arabs but the islamic openenigs were centuries ago! we speak better arabic than u and better french than u and better english than u despite the fact that we dont use it on a daily basics! as for me i have a BA in english literature and teaching! i have a good accent as well as we have special courses for pronunciation and speaking! as for my writings i do teach better than i write;) it is internet im not going 2b so formal:p
it is bcz of arabs like u it is bcz of arabs like u that we are excluding ourselves! but beware that there is no difference between arabs nor maghrebins nor any other ethnicity! bcz Allah look into our hearts and how pious we r!
Baya, you don't use English on a daily "basics"? I rest my case. This is not a case of "text speak"; it is a case of fluency and your post doesn't reflect solid knowledge of English grammar and vocabulary . Also, I have heard Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians speak English, even ones that earned a university degree in English, and their pronunciation is never that of a native speaker. A good friend of mine has a Moroccan wife who has a PhD in English from one of their major universities and although her grammar and vocabulary was great, she couldn't really tutor because students wanted someone who had a native accent and 99 times out of a hundred, that will not be someone who studied English in a foreign university.   Sorry, but my wife was an English teacher for many years and still tutors, and I am still surprised at what passes for "teaching" in many cases.
And don't get me started on verb agreement, such as "Allah <b>look<u>s</u></b> into our hearts".... ;)  Stick to teaching Arabic, my dear :)
soooooooooo soooooooo any institutions here??
I advised Shiz. Go to Al Fanar. They have classes for men and women (separately) and even teach the Qatari dialect. Plus they are nice people there. :)
are you that stupid to Baya  are you that stupid to say that you know arabic more than me !!!  by the way i think i know you because there is only a few tunisian in Qatar who teaches English and franch   and i can reach you easily for saying that you speak arabic better than me   we will see then who can speak arabic and i will see if  you dare to say this in my face     this is the internet and every one can say whatever he or she want  but in the real world you will shrink like an ant in front of me
oohh qatarrii y u gettng so oohh qatarrii y u gettng so seriouss... evryone is rite aat ther plaace but no need to be soo serious we all knw u are best....but mayb baya is also best 4anyone... well...can u teach me arabiic:P:D butt be cool yrr....:)
can you give me any contact can you give me any contact information?
is there any girl who can teach me arabic language? if there is one can you PM me i really need one...  thank you...
My neighbor teaches spoken/written Arabic :) excellent! Please PM me for details ONLY if you are serious!!!!
Berlitz offers arabic Berlitz offers arabic speaking lessons but I think its standard arabic not Qatari dialect. If that is what you want, contact them.

i will gove you learn i will gove you learn arabic.that is very simple.but where are you staying.give me your details.apakader2002@yahoo.com
your perception is wrong your perception is wrong about tunisians or morrocons... they speak good arabic and french too... one can easily understand them... they use to speak with one another in their native accent...
Don't they have Arabic taught by natives at Al Fanar? My wife took a course there not too long ago. I think her teacher was a qatari woman.
Baya, I hope you don't teach English the way you write! :)    Every non-native speaker who knows some English seems to fancy themselves an English tutor but people should remember that accent is an important part of learning a language. Remember, you get what you pay for.
ask any local to teach ask any local to teach english or french, even they know it to full extent but they can't manage to teach...! teaching itself is a tough job, you have to first prepare yourself to speak out...
Is there a place to rent a motorcycle I'll only be in Doha for 3 months and would rather rent a Motorcycle then rent a car, now that the weather is cooling off. I haven't been into the one dealership I saw because I think they're only selling new bikes right? Its difficult for me to find phone numbers for these places so if anyone had some input on the best way to start riding here I would be most grateful.
Budget rental company rent Budget rental company rent out Harley Davidsons. But it is still very warm and humid here and will be for September also. The biggest worry would be the crazy drivers in Qatar. A car or 4x4 is much safer
These guys rent bikes: These guys rent bikes: http://www.q-biker.com/  Strikes me as a bit pricy, but then I am new round these parts!

I am looking for a Honda CBR600rr or Yamaha R6</p><p>Hope there is somebody out there who can help</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Track Days <p>I was running a bike rental (the only one in Qatar), but I closed it down.</p><p>There was one customer, who rented a bike fom me for the track once and it was a lot of administrative effort to make it happen. Not worth the few bucks for the rental, but I did it anyway.</p><p>The customer tried other sources, but nobody else was crazy enough to lend a bike for the track ;-))</p><p>You will have to buy a bike of your own, I am afraid.</p><p>I still have two Ducati Monster S4RS for sale.</p><p>And I have a racing suit (Size 54) and helmet, almost for free.</p><p>Good Luck</p><p>RSt</p>

Bikes Rental Hi Robby,  I've been trying to do a come back after abandoning the sport for 25 years, I only got hooked up again when my kids grew up and started to create the adventure in me again (as usual they started with the quads) I've been looking for a used bike that is in the 250cc range, not less than 2 cylinders, weighing 400 Lb or less, and seat hight of not more 31" (I'll feel more confident when both feet flat on the ground), you've guessed it right Kawasaki Ninja 250R is best fit.  I had no luck at all finding such bike not even the dealership have them in stock until end of the year, but I wanted to practice during the remainder of the season.  Any advice is highly appreciated.  BTW: I've just started a thread on your web site (www.q-biker.com) hope to see it growing.  Regards
We rent motorcycles in Qatar Hi Burak22,  Please feel free to check our web site:  www.q-biker.com  for the available models.   Off course, you will enjoy a very good rate, if you rent a motorcycle long term. That is the same, as if you rent a car.  You may as well drop by in the shop and speak with my sales guy.

Motorcycle Rental Qatar Hi Shanester,  Yes, we rent motorcycles in Qatar.  ... and we are the only company who does it at the moment. Budget has given up.  ... well, motorcycle rentals are, what you may call, "pricy" all over the world. That roots in the nature of the business. You may as well consider, to look up some international rental prices for your reference.  Best regards RSt

Not sure of the quality but Not sure of the quality but they have a long waiting list - a few months - and they do not do orthodontic work.
OK, thanks I am trying to find "The Best" dental care in Doha, and everything I hear about is OK, at best.  I was in an accident that involved major dental/maxillary trauma, so I need the best care rather than "OK" care.    Sigh. . .

US Educational Group Qlrs who attended the US educational Group siminar yesterday at the movenpick tower; which University sounded as a Good leveled one,good campus and supports and with an accepted Tuition fees ?  Kindly share your thoughts !  Enjoy!
RE: US Educational Group Which ones are you thinking about?
RE: US Educational Group Mandilulr, Frankly there were so many but what i prefered the most are: Kentucky university and Virginia Commonwealth University; Roger Williams University is good too but its fees are even higher...  So still not sure bout it, besides i need also to kno which state is better to be at !  So what you think ?
RE: US Educational Group Wow, you are looking at VERY different schools. The University of Kentucky is a large (huge) state school offering almost all possible course of study and where the students will be mostly from Kentucky. Roger Williams is a small, elite liberal arts school in Rhode Island. If you like Virginia Commonwealth, your best bet is to stay in Doha rather than going all the way to Richmond, Virginia. There are thousands and thousands of school in the US, you may want to narrow them down by size, majors offered and geographical area. Not to mention admissions criteria! By the way, you are getting late for admissions for next fall.
RE: US Educational Group PS, they will ALL be very expensive these days! Minimum of $25,000 USD per year for tuition and expenses.
RE: US Educational Group Yea im a little bit late but this is intentional, coz im not plannin to go straight ahead, im lebanese working in Qatar, and movin to USA is not that easy thing, it needs planning and previous studies including financial status and lively hood and so on.... you are right regarding the tuition fees, all exceeded 25000 $ , but they have scholarships at to 12000$ and a student ccan work up to 20 hrs per week and so on... so we'll c ...i think im gonna go for that by 2010  thanks for the help :D Enjoy!

RE: How can i send mobile phone to India? go to airport ask somebody to do u a favor to bring the mobile phone or send to your home by courrier am sure its cheaper but give some money to the one who will carry your phone.
RE: How can i send mobile phone to India? Try Skycom / www.skycomex.com (near airport)they seem to be very good I have used them before to send 2 mobiles to the USA and it cost about QAR 200
RE: How can i send mobile phone to India? Send the mobile, with any of ur friends or their friends, who will be travelling to JAIPUR. Instead of increasing the cost of the mobile by sending skycom or DHL or ARAMEX or any courier company. Since all the mobile brands are available in INDIA, send the money there, let them purchase it from there.   Regards
RE: How can i send mobile phone to India? just inquire from your community who stayed in your place as to whoever goes for a vacation. or better you go home and bring the unit to your place and come back afterwards

Finger Print Location Dear Friends,  Can you please tell me the location for finger print office in doha.  Thanks
RE: Finger Print Location Keep on Salwa road. (this is the main road that radiates out of Doha from the Ramada signal and takes you to the Saudi Border). So, keep on Salwa Road and you will cross Midmac round-about (now a flyover) Decoration round-about, Wholesale Market round-about, Aziziya round-about and another small round-about before coming to the new flyover which has replaced Industrial Area round-about. Go straight over the Industrial Area flyover, and keep to the right lane. About 500 mts after the flyover, and just before the next interchange, there is a road to the right, perpendicular to the main road. Take this right turn and on your right hand side is the new CEID department building where you can have your finger prints taken. I got it done for my family in less than 15 minutes.

Really? How is the weather like in Qatar?  The weather is generally pleasant in winter and hot and humid during the summer months. Winter daytime temperatures average a very pleasant 20-35 degrees Celsius (68-95 degrees Fahrenheit), although nights can be relatively cool. You will need to wear a sweater or a light coat during the winter. In summer, the temperature gets as high as 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).   50Degree??

Which school is better Voltaire or Bonaparte Hey, Considering a move to Qatar. What do you recommend as a French speaking school? Voltaire or Bonaparte?
Tony, there are French Tony, there are French schools in Qatar? Never heard of them..;/
tonyhanna1, I would suggest tonyhanna1, I would suggest you a few points to avoid regret in future; Just after your arrival, as a parent you should visit both schools yourself. You should check the school's curriculum; activities plan and the academic calendar...ask for the strength of the particular class and see the premises... If youre satisfied by all means, then decide yourself where to enroll your child.

Lol Edifis..Wondering what they teach at Elton John School?... Wondering what they teach at Elton John School?...
Jack any such institutes Jack any such institutes propagating any banned ideologies like homosexuality are not allowed in Qatar!
Jack they teach you all about Jack they teach you all about 'candle in the hind'
Thank you and WoW Thank you Edifis, I agree that your summary is a great insight into these institutions. It will surely help us in making our decision! I'll get back to you on it (hehe nice comment about the gauls btw)
Level of French Dear Edifis,As we are finalizing our move to Qatar, I thought I'd ask you this question. We were told that the level of French in Voltaire might be low due to the blend with non-French speakers. Do you know anything about that?
great reviews! Dear Edifis, on the contrary ur reviews were very helpful! are u in the field of education? that is what made me want to know more from you
Voltaire or Bonaparte? Bonaparte is probably much more famous than Voltaire. Apart from "Candide", no one bothers with Voltaire's literary works any more. Yes, he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought, but Napoleon's influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound. I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler, as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe, from the gates of Moscow to Madrid. On the other hand, Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide. To be fair to Napoleon, it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms. So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815, but he certainly continued them, very successfuly for a long while, and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons.
Both are good schools Both are good schools but Bonaparte will teach your kids to become a good leader but they concentrate mainly on outdoor physical activities, manoeuvers & strategies. Horse riding and lances & swords are their speciality. They also concentrate on proper health hygiene & sanitation and frequently remind the kid about properly using water in the loo..which the gauls generally dislike!  So they will make a good manager & strategist of you kid!  on the other hand Voltaire will make your child more of a philosopher! They encourage independent thinking...and mainly concentrates on indoor activities! They inculcate good moral values in the child and he will surely grow up to be a thinking person! In school they encourage kids to read great works of science and fiction. The literary skills in your kid will bloom. In addition they also teach the art of candid photography & journalism! Specialization: Wit & sattire in poetry & Prose!
we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. my husband and i wish to combine our salary to make it 7k riyal so that we can sponsor our daughter in the philippines.  she is 4 years old. is it possible for us to do that. please advise, thank you
RE: we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. You or your husband must have a Family status visa and earn more than QR4500. If either of you earn at least Qr4500 per month you can ask your employer to change your visa to a Family visa. Then you can bring your daughter in and do the requirements.  Without the minimum salary of one person, they wont normally change your visa status (unless you know someone, who knows someone)
RE: we wish to sponsor our daughter from the phils. Ok, you need to do couple of things: 1- NOC from your employer addressing the ministry of interior 2- certificate of salary no less then QR7000. (used to be QR4500) 3- Bank statement of salary for at least 6 months 4- a copy of your reisdence electricy bill 5- a copy of your accommodation bill 6- Marriage certificate - a copy of the passport of the mother.  Good luck & Bonne chance,  Cheers!
Is it mandatory to book return ticket on visit visa ? Is it mandatory to book return ticket for Indian Nationality on visit visa ?
RE: Is it mandatory to book return ticket on visit visa ? thanx for the info ... tht was much helpful
RE: Is it mandatory to book return ticket on visit visa ? I'm in Doha for the second time on visit visa and both times I travelled with one-way ticket.
RE: Is it mandatory to book return ticket on visit visa ? Yes, it is. To my knowledge airlines will not issue an "Okay to Board" letter if there is no return ticket on a visit visa. Also, one can take a four-month return ticket at the same cost and change the date of exit once one is here.
RE: Is it mandatory to book return ticket on visit visa ? Yes it is, that too return ticket date should be maximum one month from the date of arrival. Once arrived here in Doha you can cancel or change date as per your requirement. Indian Authorities wont allow to board the aircraft if return ticket it not available

Do you think this salary package is good? 51000 tax free, free accmodation, transportation allowance, World wide medical cover, 30 days paid annual leave and family schooling?  They have said their are other family benefits but I am still waiting on further details.  Do you think this is a good offer?  How expensive is it to live in Doha in terms of food, utility bills etc?  Thanks
and for schooling, you have and for schooling, you have to make it clear you want to send the kids to the british curriculum school. And make sure the company will pay FULL FEES not percentage.
Good Good offer , as long as they pay for accomodation and Schools other things is sheap.
Good Offer...Go for Good Offer...Go for It....GOODLUCK
It is a good offer go for It is a good offer go for it, but like Novita said, get it all in writing first. We didn't get all we were promised and it can be a massive let down.
hmmmmmm. No worries bout d foods n bills out here,,, alla is cheap... but bills in school and in accomodation,,, OMG!  But gudluck then...  We were given: Two hands to hold. To legs to walk. Two eyes to see. Two ears to listen. But why only one heart? Because the other was given to someone else. For us to find.
I'm not much sure about your I'm not much sure about your needs and taste. But if you get everything for free of cost but your food, then its a decent offer. I guess you've already posted about his prospective employer. And if they are directly hiring your hubby then I'd say stick on to it.   ---If you can't CONVINCE them, CONFUSE them!!!

what are vasta and who are they?? i jus read abt this vasta,can anyone tell me how can dey help in gettin a residence visa/family visa...is it possile 2 get a visa if one doesnt have 7000 salary..pls help urgent
RE: what are vasta and who are they?? lol...  Vastha means 'HOLD' or the 'POWER' .. For example. . If u want a family visa, if u have someone for recomendation it is called vaastha..
RE: what are vasta and who are they?? "WASTA" is an Arabic word which means Reference to get thru in
RE: what are vasta and who are they?? There is no vasta company, everyone is vaasta for someone for something when in need. that is arabic terminology meaning only a support/help recommending to get something to get easily. that is vaaasta.
RE: what are vasta and who are they?? If you are a muslim, then pray two rakae istikhara, and sit in the place for a while after finishig the prayer, and in few minutes you will get feed back about what you have to do with it and do according to that. Wish you God speed in your new endeavour.  If you are a nonmuslim, leave things to God., and just move it as u wish and what seems to be good and what is in your destiny that will make it easier for you. That is all, none can change your decreed formulae in your life except Allah the almighty. That is it.

Thyroidism and Maturity Is it true that a 21 year old patient suffering from thyroidism behaves like a 15 year old?
Well, that's me who have Well, that's me who have asked that question! :)
If this question is not a If this question is not a joke, then the answer is, not necessarily.
han19 To be frank, its not a joke. I'm just curious!
There are two types of There are two types of thyroidism, hyper and hypo. Does it cause immaturity in terms of how the mind or intelligence works, then the answer is , not necessarily. I had a friend in post grad college who has hypot, but was the most intelligent in the class n batch that she was a topper.
I know its stupid, but I have I know its stupid, but I have a plenty questions to ask.   1. Can thyroidism be considered as a terminal illness?  2. Is it genetic or can a child inherit thyroidism from a parent?  3. (I have more questions to ask, but people may consider me as someone without brains!)
As sid said, the irregularity As sid said, the irregularity in the secretion of thyroid gland has an effect on your metabolism rates. One could be depressed or feeling stressed out almost everytime due to its effects on the brain but its not known to affect the intelligence.
Can thyroid cause anxiety Can thyroid cause anxiety related diseases?
Doha Knight I didn't mean anything like manias or phobias. Now let me come to the point, can thyroid cause anxiety related hand tremors?
Can I sell my mobile phone ? If I bring my mobile phones from overseas and want to change with a new mobile in Doha, is there any mobile phone shop will buy my mobile phone as 2nd hand price? Thank you.

girlfriend visiting Hi. I am going to be posted to work in Qatar. I heard that it is illegal for unmarried couple to stay together in Qatar? is that true? and if so, if my gf would to visit me on a visit pass for a couple of weeks, can she stay with me? thanks for your help!
Can not stay... As per the law, its true... unmarried couples can not stay together in the same place, but trust me... There are alot of unmarried couples staying together here. The only way to go abt it is by not making a major talk-show abt it.
what if.. Thanks for replying. But what if neighbours or God knows who report me in? How sensitive is this matter in Qatar?
she may stay with u but she may stay with u but don't get caught... goodluck on that.   <a href="http://photobucket.com/images/glitter%20icons" target="_blank"><img src="http://i117.photobucket.com/albums/o74/jlb0512/icons/glitter.gif" border="0" alt="glitter Pictures, Images and Photos"/></a>
Better not do it...and if Better not do it...and if you were caught, you and she will be lashed, jailed and deported, if you live in in Phils. dont do it here, dont get inspired by the reality that there were some here living together who are not legally married, you will regret...  &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &quot;<em><strong>There's nothing we can do to change the past, if it teaches you a lesson profit from it then, forget it.&quot;</strong></em> </p>
thanks everyone.. Even if I am not a Muslim I presume. So the only arrangement for having someone visiting is to put her in a hotel? Is that alright then?
So you're saying that So you're saying that slandering a school is more serious than co-habiting with a member of the opposite sex who isn't your spouse?
yes tallq slandering a school can be serious especially if it is not true and for your information the owner of that school building is working from the government at Qatar University. so Pike is in serious trouble there. but individually cases like living with someone who is not their spouse is not a big deal for them as too many of these case here. I'll give you an example. One of my neightbor send her maid to jail when the maid stole some of her jewelries and some money and run off with a local guy. the maid was sent to jail for 1 year for stealing and not for running away with the guy who helped her. The lawyer told the maid's sponsor it is the maids business if she wants to practise her sexual activities with other man although the maid is married back home.
There is no problem, she is There is no problem, she is your cousin/best friend and she is seeing you after ages....that's all :-) But I hope you are staying on your own. I don't know what's all the fuss about. She is coming for a few weeks to spend time with you...how are CID's involved in this, That's just BS!
Thanks everyone Thanks everyone. I read through all the comments. I guess it is a sticky situation to begin with. I am still a little confused. Maybe I'll just have a talk with my girlfriend and see what is the best way for us to work this out. Thanks for all the advice.
there is no any problem for there is no any problem for the VISITORS! as Shaine said she might be one of your family members who is just visiting Qatar and you happened to live and work here...Don't announce the whole world about your relationship and you will be all right. She only came to VISIT you, nothing wrong with that. And dont think that I advise to violate the law. Again, you definitely cannot live together while both are working here, you cannot be common-in-law here. But visiting definitely everyone can come and visit his/her friends here, nothing wrong with that  <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

One other issue to consider One other issue to consider is whether or not you will be in company housing. People tend to be a little more judgmental when they are sharing the same accomodations. Hotels are best. Mandi
dan281 first of all you don't need to inquire your situation here. second of all expect both negative and positive answers. and third of all you don't tell to other people that she is just your girlfriend that you live together in 1 roof it's not their business to know, for goodness sake this is not Saudi Arabia. you just have to be careful to bump to any nosey people that may report you. Chill out enjoy your time with your love ones!
Jamon, your advice may be Jamon, your advice may be well-meaning but perhaps not very accurate. Yes, there are people who will say yes and no but Dan needs to consider the issues and consequences. His profile says that he is a pilot. IF (an assumption) he is working for QR and living in their housing and his girlfriend sashays in and out every couple of months I suspect that he will be busted sooner than later. QR is pretty strict. He will have to decide if it's worth losing his job and being deported for violating company policy as well as Qatar law. Can he get away with it? Yes, probably for a while. Will he? I suspect not and the consequences are severe. It's not just a slap on the wrist. Mandi
If someone reports you If someone reports you you'll must probably be deported.  jamon - I think it is illegal for an un-married man and woman to live in the same house, even if they aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, so not telling people she is your girlfriend will make no difference.  also jamon - I find it odd your encouraging someone to break the law while in another thread you are mentioning that CID watch the site and will trace IPs and act on things if they're reported.
an few days ago a flat was raided by CID, 3 couples are living as husband and wife (not married). They are now in Jail.  "katas ng qatar"
enjoy man stay and enjoy dont say

How did you react ? What is your Opinion about a mandatory dress code for Women?
RE: How did you react ? Should be enforced everywhere.
RE: How did you react ? I have not heared of such thing! Are you sure?
RE: How did you react ? details pls... never heard any except for traditional one...
RE: How did you react ? It is OK but in general rules such as: choose 3-4 colors, skirts only, no transparent materials, no tight cloths, must put a jacket.....etc.
RE: How did you react ? Bikini's should be mandatory on good looking women.  However, fat trogs should be forced to wear something to cover it all up.
Any SPANISH around??? Hello... I was wondering if there is any spanish club or association? or any other Spaniards out there? I will appreciate if anyone let me know.  Ps.

Salsa Dancing Check out Paloma at Intercontinental Hotel.  They have live salsa, bachatta, and cumbia music.  But go early...I would say 8-ish to see the band and have room to dance. It gets packed later at night but the DJ doesn't play any latin music. The DJ starts around 11pm I think, so before that it's good.  Buena suerte!

Where is Palm Gardens 1 compound? Hi all,  There is a villa there I would like to check out but since its the weekend and Ramadan I can't get hold of the agents. All I know is that it is in the abu hamour area but that's a pretty big area. It is not palm gardens 2 which is near the rugby club. Anyone have any idea? Thanks!
google maps google maps
Tried that but nothing comes Tried that but nothing comes up. :(
Near AL WAAB Near AL WAAB
Thanks for the help guys. I Thanks for the help guys. I drove all over the Al Waab area and did see the palm city gardens compound but that's not it. This compound is run by BetterHomes and according to their listing on their website this compound is in Abu Hamour. So I went driving all over that area to no avail as well.  I have tried contacting them a few times but nobody has bothered to get back to me. Maybe I should try again after Ramadan.

Ban on crabbing Ilaya: Yes it happened to us last nite. They waited in their land cruiser (with government logo). They took our spears. They told us "no crabbing at nite and in the morning". We were puzzled because we had been crabbing for few times and last nite was the first incident somebody came and took our spears. We were at Al-Khor sealine.

RE: Can I be a Qatari? Yes you can...
Mothercare I'm moving to Doha soon-- and expecting. Is Mothercare there the same as in the UK, so I should be able to buy everything I need at a reasonable price? I'd be happy to find any decent alternative stores too!  Thanks.
Everything is available Everything is available here...on double price.
Yes Not only Mothercare, but there are more similar shops where you can buy what ever you want
-- the main ones will be mothercare and babyshop. i had stumbled upon a baby/mother department in Lulu supermarket/hypermarket, which offers pretty good range of things you need. let me know if you have anything in mind that you think you might not find it here in Doha. so that you dont have to buy from UK.
Yup Mother care is here, so Yup Mother care is here, so is baby shop which both are very good quality and stuff.
mothercare / babyshop / max / mothercare / babyshop / max / Jameel / the wear house and many more you will discover more when you will arrive
P, etc Yes Mothercare, ELC, M&P, etc are here - but not reasonably priced, you will see the price in pounds and then the extortionate price in riyals.  I only buy what I have to from here, everything else I bring over from the UK...
Just to give you an idea...in Just to give you an idea...in M&S I picked up a pair of shoes for my little one, the price tag said 16 and QAR150...
true say Snessy you are true say Snessy you are right. I would buy everything from the UK   They are definitely double the price and in some cases triple
I've experienced the same I've experienced the same snessy. I got 1 piece of maternity blouse here for almost QR500. With the same amount, I was able to buy 4 to 5 pairs in the Phils, better quality, nicer design. Some of their prices are TERRIBLE.
-- just my 5 cent worth of opinion: not all the things you need, you should buy abroad just because they are more expensive in doha. i wouldnt buy a baby cot and brought it over to doha. likewise for diapers (pampers). how many packs of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply, just because they might be cheaper abroad. my opinion is you should consider buying things, which are not in Qatar, from your home country. even if you try to avoid paying more on baby stuff, you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time paying less for other things too, like car and petrol.
Alibaba Website - Any Comments I was searching for some spare parts for my car, and found the same online in a website "based in China" called "alibaba.com":  - anybody heard of the same?  - anybody ordered anything from them?  - they said that they will send the parts by DHL but they want the payment in advance, can I trust them? any comments on this subject will be appreciated?  Thanks
Alibaba I have found that they don't respond to emails and seem to be focused on very big businesses wanting to set up large export details. my advice is that if you want to do business in China you need an agent that you can trust in China. I would steer well away from ordering anything on the web from China.
You can Order. As i order Some car parts and i got it on time, No problem i have also send them in Advance as i talked to the person on phone and order via Alibaba, you can go head.
use ebay, better use ebay, better
@osama Are you buying the part from Alibaba OR from some supplier registered on Alibaba??
Baby's visa Hi,my wife will be arriving with the new born baby next month. My wife is having RP upto september end. Our child will be 2 months and 6 days old when they arrive. So, is a Visa required for my child? I have heard that for 3 months no visa is required. So please let me know the rule for such a case. Thank you in advance
RE: Baby's visa Visa is not required for a baby of lessthan 3 month old who will accompany his/her mother. Visa will be issued after their arrival on condition that mothers passport must carry a valid RP.
RE: Baby's visa If the age of your new born baby is less than 3 month no need for visa, but the birth certificate should be there and it should be attested by Qatar embassy in your home country. I did this way when I brought my daughter 3 month ago, she was 40 days old only.
RE: Baby's visa My friend, me too just got my baby visa stamped today only. when i checked, i came to know that it is for two [2] months only. New born Baby can travel anywhere with only passport without visa for two [2] months only. If it exceeds even one day, you have to apply for the sponsorship for the child. This is what recently updated. since my baby born in qatar, i got it done within two [2] months and each day penalty will be Qrs. 10/- will be charged.
RE: Baby's visa DONT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE COMMENTS, SOME ONE MISGUIDE ME ALSO WHEN I BRING MY CHILD IT IS STILL 3 MONTH, AND I WAS FORCED TO BRING MY CHILD WITHIN 2 MONTHS, YOU CAN BRING YOUR CHILD WITHIN 90 DAYS AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY VISA. UP ON ARRIVAL THEY WILL GIVE YOU ONE MONTH VISA AND WITHIN ONE MONTH YOU NEED TO STAMP YOUR CHILD'S VISA. IT IS TOO EASY.
RE: Baby's visa My friend. I suggest you to go personally to Immigration dept. and enquire everthing over there. You better try to get information from the typist over there. they are highly informative and updated.
RE: Baby's visa A baby born out of DOHA if travels within 90 days (from its country of birth to doha) from the date of his/her born, there is no need of any VISA for new born.. The only thing is that both the parents should have valid RP inorder to bring the NEW BORN without visa..A baby can get visa on arrival.. Make sure that your wife should bring BIRTH CERTIFICATE alongwith her.. Some related link as per your query to give you more idea..thnx http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1171487 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1231842
RE: Baby's visa The new rule states that - "If the birth was occurred outside the country and father and mother or one of them possess valid residence permit in the country, the new born baby can enter the country within two years from the date of birth."  Here is a link to the page which states the above:   http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/news/2009/12/14/21278.html  Hope this helps.
Mashreq Credit card anybody knows here regarding my outstanding balance in my credit card in mashreq bank. Do I need to pay my remaining balance in my credit card if I will be terminated?
RE: Mashreq Credit card If you were terminated by your employer and you have the credit shield option, then the insurance will pay for your outstanding. Ask Mashreq bank if you have credit shield
RE: Mashreq Credit card what most people dont understand is that there are terms and condition for Credit shield   these are some of them that I remember when i was in the bank 1. Regualar payments  2. its takes 90 days to get approved in that time you still have to pay if you miss once it doesnt work. 3. Honestly being in the credit card section you will not believe the way you get ripped off.  4. Your company has to be listed.  5. termination not because of bad behavior or anything thats your Fault  7. Credit shield is a pain in the ass.   How i manage my credit card its unbelievable.  I have not cancelled my credit shield but i have never paid for it too  how do i do tht i make my payments before the bill is made as in i make the full payments.
RE: Mashreq Credit card but ive heard that maybe the bank will take my outstanding balance from my benefits. is that true?
RE: Mashreq Credit card but ive heard that maybe the bank will take my outstanding balance from my benefits. is that true?
Maple Syrup Where can i find good quality Maple Syrup? The particular recipe requires a good "GRADE B" Maple Syrup.Im not sure what that is..help ?
RE: Maple Syrup i think i have seen it in MegaMart. But i personally bring it straight from Canada.
RE: Maple Syrup try to visit THE CENTER behind ramada hotel u can maple serup there!!!
RE: Maple Syrup You can find maple syrup in MegaMart, but it's not cheap.  I don't know if it will be Grade A or Grade B, though. I *think* I've even seen small bottles at Carrefour. . .and ditto on the price.  Don't worry too much about the Grade A vs Grade B.  The grocery stores tend to sell Grade A because consumers associate "A" with being superior to "B".  The Grade B does have a slightly nicer flavor, but Grade A will work just fine in your recipes.  Like someone else mentioned, we bring ours in from the U.S. because it's much much less expensive. I think I brought at least three or four liters with me!  Enjoy :o)
RE: Maple Syrup Have you tried Giant at Hyatt Plaza. They have an aisle that is full of imported good from the USA.
RE: Maple Syrup Well ok im gonna try the Crntre and then Mega mart, wish i had asked my mom to bring in maple syrup from canada she just visited about 2 months ago. Anyways i hope i find good ones here. Thanks all!
will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? Ive been here to Doha a month ago and I have a business visa. My employer is already processing my working visa. If ever I will resign and tranfer to another company, will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? What are the problems will I encounter? Please help.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If you don't have a Residence Permit you are not required to obtain an N.O.C. so from what i understand of your question, you are free to change employers at any time.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If ever you resign from your existing sponsor, you will require NOC(no objection certificate) from your last sponsor to again get a visa. If you resign & exit Qatar then for 2 years you cannot get a work visa without the previous sponsors NOC.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? if you already have KAMA KALAS YOU NEED NOC TO CHANGE SPONSORSHP AND THS VERY DFFCULT BECUSE MOST OF SPONSORSHPS EVEN F YOU FNSHNG CONTRACT DURATON THEY DONT LKE TO GVE NOC THE MPORTANT S F YOU DDNT GO FNGER SCAN NO PROBLEM GO HOME AND CHANGE THE PASSPORT AND COME BY NEW VSA ( FNGER PRNT VERY MPORTANT ) GOOD LUCK
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? I disagree to Mohan Thomas, even she resigns so long as she's not resident in qatar, then she's free to comeback here in doha in another visa.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? You said "processing" so it means you are not yet sponsored by your current employer.  You can resign but bear in mind that you have a limited time to stay here for a business visa or else you have to pay the penalty when your visa expires.  So if u will resign, make sure there is one position ready for you and willing to give sponsorship or even pay the penalty when your visa expires during processing.  Goodluck!!!
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? You have to do the following actions before you go for medical and fingerprint processes if you want to change the job, 1. Resign from present job.  2. Go back to your origin.  3. Come back with new employer. You cannot change job here itself, coz your sponsor is present employer. All the best
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? If your employer has paid for your coming to Doha and your visa he will probably not look too kindly on your taking the opportunity to find another job. Transferring your employment means an NOC. If your sponsor hasn't processed your RP but has paid for everything it would be immoral to use this loophole to skip on him. These kinds of shenanigans are the reason for the strict laws in Qatar.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? Mandilulur, FYI my present company is trimming down their manpower everyday. Most of my co-workers have been given their termination papers, after that they won't care about what happens to you. I don't want to wait for my turn. I just want to know my options. Our situations are not being considered in this case. I have no bad intentions towards my company but I'm just looking after my livelihood and survival. Thanks for your comments.
RE: will I be ban? Or do I have to exit Qatar? The first issue here you enter in Qatar with Business Visa it is renewable up to 90 days. Second,the company who issued you a business visa it is your sponsor, if you working visa still on process with the same sponsor you are not allowed to look for new sponsor. Third, if you came here and use business visa as your entry document and your purpose is to look for other company, still you need NOC from your sponsor, I mean from the company who issued you a business visa.
Best place in Thailand for vacation Hi: I am a single guy and am planning to spend 3 weeks in Thailand around Christmas. I have never been there before. I scuba dive and travel a fair amount. Any suggestions of where to go and what to do? Thx
Phuket. going there this Phuket. going there this august 9 :)
you will have to.. tell me,,,, I heard that the scuba was good off of Phuket??  like all you have to do is get a good place to stay,, and that there are plenty of dive shops and boats,,tours,,,
you will love Pattaya so you will love Pattaya so much when it comes to night life and the Night Market at Patpong in Bangkok.
I believe the scuba around I believe the scuba around Hua Hin isn't so great. My favorite travel site for Thailand is the Fodor's Thailand forum. www.fodors.com, click on Forums then Thailand. Search for scuba. I would say Phuket is a good place to start, or Koh Samui.  Mandi
never been to thailand yet but been to some other places, and whenever i planned to go to one place i always check it first in TripAdvisor.  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g293915-Thailand-Vacations.html  check it out and have a wonderful time on your trip.
The best place in Pet Pone  The best place in Bangkok Thailand
Hey there mmyke first of all - have a great time. this is a great place. If you're looking for a great yet not expensive hotel try the Accor, they have something called "city super sale" and give great prices there - http://pea.to/amp12
ayutthaya for me. but it's ayutthaya for me. but it's not a beach area so you can't scuba dive there. i love the temple ruins.  don't know about the beaches and the scuba sites though coz there are better beaches and dive sites in my own country imo.  try to stay at hostels so you can meet other travelers and get cheap travel tips from others. apart from the affordable accommodation of course.  you're gonna be staying for three weeks so it would be best to try all places in the country. or travel by land to neighboring countries in indochina like vietnam or cambodia. never been to these countries myself but i'm planning to when i go home for my vacation this year.  would've loved to try watching one of the 'shows' in patpong when i went to bangkok a couple of years ago but imy travel buddy back then was such a killjoy.
I travelled around Thailand I travelled around Thailand 3 years ago... I really fell in love with Koh Samui even though its very touristic... I have a contact that owns a small resort called Shambala really cheap beach accomodation and I mean Cheap! but really well maintained... can pass it on if you want Coral & Raya island are the best in my view for diving as they have Fab reefs and are away from the hustle & bustle...  If you want somewhere really remote then head to Ko Adang, this is where you find amazing jungle, waterfalls & great nature....  Just be safe whereever you end up.. we were robbed of everythin in the first 10 days!! they packed up all our stuff and left us with NOTHING! however it was the best 3 months of Travelling that I did!

Restaurant similar to KSA When I was in a restaurant in KSA to eat rice and chicken, they spread a big plastic sheet on the carpet where I was sitting. Then rice will be poured and chicken will follow. There is a nice salad and marinated mix of tomato and herbs to dip the chicken. I have to eat with my fingers because this is more effective than utensils.  Is there a restaurant similar to what I mentioned. If there is, restaurant and location please.

Fresh Graduates Hi. I am back and i have a new query. =)  I am a fresh Graduate from the Philippines. I am visiting qatar this month. I have tickets! I am sponsored by my Arab stepfather.  I just want to know if there are lots of job oppurtunities for me there(qatar). I am a nursing graduate but i also consider to get involve in works that are not really related to my course.  Thanks for those who will reply.
Wow that is so great! Then, i will be lying on the floor weeping! Tsk tsk..
Usually, all the nurses in Usually, all the nurses in abroad working for a long time has at least experience working in their country. I haven't seen a fresh graduate working right away abroad unless he/she can afford going abroad. now it will all depend on the employer abroad is he/she will be accepted working with them.   goodluck with your job hunt :D
Your chances will be working Your chances will be working in a private clinics. Just make sure you are a Board passer coz they required license for Nurses to work in Qatar.
How about other jobs? like in hotels Yes thanx.. Well, if im not really sure i could get a job then i could cancel the tickets.. But Qatar is great.. I am not into traveling for vacation. lol.
are you a board passer now? are you a board passer now?
Good positions for fresh graduates normally go to Qataris. You may be able to get a job in a private company that pays really badly and the locals do not want. In that case I hope Arab step father lets you stay with him
NOt.. Not yet still waiting for the results maybe this month..

Depends on what features you Depends on what features you use most.  1.Phone calls and Sms  2.Camera 3.Internet/Email 4.Chatting  most of the smart phones can offer you all of the above, but my suggestion is dont go in for a smart phone if you are not going to use all of its features.

iPhone 4...it's the other man iPhone 4...it's the other man in my life!
Smoke is correct. Decide what you want to do with your phone. Does it / will do the basics well?  How much do you want to spend? Do you want a true multi media device Do you want email / internet on the go Do you want good camera capability?  Smart phones these days are capable of doing so much, that many of the features just do not get used. For example, how many people use the voice management on their device?  I know the kind of things I want with my phone, so decide that first, then go shopping.
you havent told what you plan you havent told what you plan to do with the phone. That will help you get a better opinion.

Tips on saving money in Qatar So, I have seen that I have been spending money more than usual.  So, I need to cut back on expenses!!  What are your tips on saving money here?
Need    vs   Want Figure out the difference between "I want this item." and "I need this item."  That should save some hard earned riyals.
drive slow!! drive slow and u can save a lot of money here in qatar!!!    [img_assist|nid=17892|title=http://braveatheart.blogspot.com/|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=135]
yep Mozzie a good piece pf yep Mozzie a good piece pf advise!  So b4 buying anything else,  always ask yourself first if you need it or just wanted it, you see the big difference.  It works for me.  Also don't go for brands names as they just almost the same as the ordinary but you will save a lot, unless it's further reduction.    Goodluck!!!!
money?....what is that? <i>money?....what is that?          ----------------------------------------------------------------<i>Give me some SunShine......Give me some Rain Give me another Chance...I wanna grow up once Again</i>
stick on QL .... its free ! stick on QL .... its free !
basic tip... am kinda new here in Qatar..but here's from my financial adviser Dr.Suze:  the basic tip to saving money, is simply to GET A GRIP, focus on where you are today:  what you have, what you owe..e.g., track your spending, calculate your net worth, check your credit profile, cut spending by 10%..in short, don't live beyond your means.  i understand how you feel..money is tight..you're busy..tackling money issues isn't fun..but you don't need all that stress..you can easily pull that off..make 2010 the year to find your financial confidence..take charge and good luck!
Dont Go to shopping malls. Stop eating fast food. and stop surfing too so you wont go for online shopping. <img src="http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif">
OK.. see???? around 10 post OK.. see???? around 10 post and CERTAINLY STILL NO ANSWER OR HELP TO MY QUESTION.
Ok Suzan fine then stop going to gym. its worthless. <img src="http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/Da.gif">
guys do not spend beyond your limit. if your earing much expect that you'll expend more yeah its true.  practice to make a list before your go for shopping.   Thank you and Best wishes  **Dont get discourage when things go beyond your imagination because the greatest glory in life is not falling but rising everytime you fall. Life is what you make it**
GYM?! Darude.. GYM?! Darude.. hummmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
as working parents, i have as working parents, i have the same problem. first i stopped using my credit card. second, i stopped going out with friends to restaurants, since lebanese are famous on fighting over the bill, and i don't like to loose a fight:)  third, we're trying our best to have our food always at home, cooking in the evening for second day lunch/dinner.  last and MOST important: make a list for your weekend shopping and STICK to the list. again STICK TO THE LIST WOMEN  STICK TO THE GOD DAMN LIST LADIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  hope this is helpful  Yalla!
& stay at home, watch tv & sleep during weekends.. this is my most effective way.. :D  temper is something u cant get rid of... by loosing it...
save money you can't save money in qatar. so try to earn more. find any good job with good salary.
abdul_26 good point LOL!
Send me your detail expense list and I'll suggest where you could cut back or reduce expenses  In general O expenses on luxury items and 90% on essential goods.

think of it that you will think of it that you will loose your job next month... surely you will think of spending a single dime!
suzan, thank Allah I'm not a suzan, thank Allah I'm not a coffee person at all. I enjoy my Rainbow and Lipton when I'm in the mood. As for SAVING, since that is your question. I think it is pretty simple. Start from the first day. When you get your salary, ex. Qr10,000, set aside Qr2,000 in a saving account that you would open. Make sure you make it a standing monthly order, so your brain will function to accept that your salary is only Qr8,000 and you would have to manage with that. Maybe you would want to start small, but 20% of your monthly pay is a great start. Then you can increase it when you manage to settle into the saving/budgeting lifestyle.   Good luck!
My tips are: <i>1:Avoid to purchase such items in advance which you think might be rarely used by you. 2: Try to compare product prices with similar products especially buying groceries/household items. 3: Avoid branded products maximum if possible e.g. Shirts,pants,trousers & shoes which can be purchased with very less prices in Musheirib Street,Souq Najada or Souq Area. 4: Maximum avoid eating from outside. 5: Try your luck by investing your savings as much as you can in DOHA BANK ALDANA SCHEME, AHLI BANK'S MY HASSAN SAVING CERTIFICATES or NATIONAL BONDS-UAE. May be you might get lucky and win MILLION RIYALS. . Sadly, I'm unable to follow none of them after getting married. :P :P :P </i>
Furthermore, <i>1: Give miss calls to others and let them call you to save your QTEL BILLS  :P :P 2: Spend maximum time in malls to save KAHRAMA bills. :P :P 3: Visit other family or friends houses just at dinner/lunch times so you can share their food and save money too :P :P  4: Why to spend money on ADSL line when you have free ADSL LINE in parks :P :P 5: Take lifts from your colleagues to & from your house to save patrol money :P :P </i>
can i sign in hindhi language in passport Will it be a ny problem if i sign in hindhi language in indian passport '
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport No Problem. You can sign in any script in any of your language. But it should not differ from one another it should be same every time you use.
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport It should be HINDI...right?
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport dude you first need to learn to spell the language properly.   i suggest you sign in Malayalam in your passport. It would be easy for you to remember.
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Even if you draw a monkey face as your signature it will be accepted. It is the consistency and duplication that matters which requires a simple yet not so easy to copy sign from you.
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Do not do it.  One day your PP would be going along with other documents like , banks, property issues, PAN Card, UID etc. Then you may face some difficulty.
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Your signature has got nothing to do with language. it could be any design, mark, clip art or any thing drawable consistently over and over and difficult to imitate by someone else. It is not expected to be 'read' but to be 'identified'.
RE: can i sign in hindhi language in passport Molten Metal..If it has to be read, about a quarter of the world population will not be able to sign.I have seen a lot of the older and simpler folks going for just one letter like "Aa","Om" etc with some dots and decimals put here and there as they like it..Some even put cross,pictures,etc.My maid  signed her name "Usha" beautifully in the Passport I took for her. It took me some time later on to realise, that is the only word she knew to "draw"...   :-(
sand storm? is it safe to drive from Khor to Doha in this weather condition?

RE: sand storm? i think u can drive coming to Doha just be carefull...
RE: sand storm? yeah..you can make it safe if you aint a Mallu Driver... no offence guys... LOL  but you yourself should have experienced what i wanna convey..  :)    Well, if you drive slow, I dont think it would be that hard...best of luck..
RE: sand storm? I would put off driving, the accident where the four Indians died was due to fog, now we have limited visability and wind not a good mix. Good luck.

how can i know how many points of traffic? how can i know how many points of traffic violation i have on the MOI website.  I went there and entered my vehicle number, it only gave me the last violation that i did not pay, but im pretty sure that i have more than 3 points.  Thanks..
rMS_000 I had OLD violations, and they are all parking tickets, no speeding not red light (Thank God)   But does anyone know where i can find how many points i have accumulated till now?
Instead of your plate No. Instead of your plate No. try your Qatar Id..
Andrews, i tried that when i placed my ID number it gave me that i should go to the MOI department, and list my violations to the ID.   I guess no one here knows the answer.   :( thanks anyway
go to www.moi.gov.qa then go to www.moi.gov.qa then click Traffic Violations and insert by ID number and it will give you how many black points you have
forgot to mention before forgot to mention before clicking traffic violations you need to enter to the E-Services once you get into the website
Traffic Violation Info via txt message send txt message TC(plate number)to 2992 >> quickest way to find out if you have any traffic violation...will not contain details on the point system though...i guess you'll have to go to the traffic department for more details.
It will take time for them It will take time for them to upload in the site. saboor ! no worries, u will get your points u owe !  -- Community Guidelines:  #5 Stay on topic and do not hijack threads or post off-topic comments...  rMs..!!

Tourist Visa Hi me and my wife is planning to visit Dubai. I heard that engineers can have visa upon arrival - is it true? Since my wife is under my sponsorship, can she have the visa upon arrival too? Thanks for your info.
RE: Tourist Visa I have work visa here in doha, also engineer, with Chinese passport, do I need to apply visa for Dubai, or do I have to have some papers from the company where I work? Thanks.
RE: Tourist Visa What about the sponsored wife can she also get visa upon arrival in Dubai? Thanks...
RE: Tourist Visa Yes, wife if accompanied by her husband will also get the visa upon arrival.
RE: Tourist Visa Since you are holding an engineer's work permit, you will surely get the visa on arrival..Your passport should be valid for more than 6 months and RP of Qatar should be valid for more than 3 months(i hope i am right with this information)..If you are not sure still, check with the UAE embassy..it would be better...  Since your wife is on your sponsorship, she too will get the visa on arrival in UAE..  Has the visa charges increased now? I've heard the last charges were DH 105..Can someone please clarify me as well???  thanks a lot in advance.

School Questions Hi Everyone!  I am so happy to find this forum and looking forward to hearing your thoughts.  We will be moving to Doha this coming summer and are currently weighing our school options.  I am looking for more information on ACS International, International School of London, and Qatar Academy.  Any information at all about the environment, quality of academics, etc at these schools would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance!
ACS seems to be getting off ACS seems to be getting off on a good footing. Qatar Academy only takes Qatari's in certain years ISL is fine   None of these schools are ranked as the best in Doha - but the chances of getting into those are not good
Thank you very much for your Thank you very much for your responses.  Pike, I would be interested in hearing more details if you don't mind?  Simonsmithy, I was under the impression Qatar Academy ranks very highly?
Yes QA is very good - but as Yes QA is very good - but as I said I am not sure whether it takes non-qataris in certain years
What would you Thank you!    What would you consider to be the best ranked schools in Doha?  Being from Canada we are looking for an American or IB curriculum to ease the transition when we return.  We will apply to ASD, but as you suggested, unlikely we will secure spots.  So we are left with ACS and ISL as I understand it.  Any others I am missing?  Thanks so much!!
ACS is your best bet after ACS is your best bet after ASD.  ASD and ACS are the only schools that truly follow an American curriculum.  it is new, but really has gotten off to a good start.  Parents are happy there.  QA is great but difficult to get in if you are not Qatari or work for QF.  Plus, the behavior of certain children who go there is rediculous.  Teachers afraid to discipline kids with a particular last name, so those kids run wild.
Hi ComingtoDoha! Any luck Hi ComingtoDoha! Any luck with Your school search?  I'm moving to Doha too from Canada and have been searching and searching.  Would love any help in this matter! ASD seems like the best option, am I right?
Do I need a lawyer? I had rented a car from a local company, they needed the car back for 1 day to get it registered. They gave me a loaner car to use and the loaner car broke down while I was driving it. The car rental company is saying its my fault and that I have to pay for a new engine on the loaner car.   I refused to pay and the car rental place said it will send it to the police and the courts.  I am an American female.  any advice?
RE: Do I need a lawyer? Tell them to go ahead.  Unless you were negligent, it's their problem.  You didn't take a sledgehammer to it, did you?  You didn't put something other than motor oil in, did you?  Seems to me you'd REALLY have to try hard to blow an engine in one day.
RE: Do I need a lawyer? Hello,  I would definately discuss  with a lawyer.  Did you sign a contract?  If so there should be a limitation on the amount you have to pay eg 1500 QAR in the event of a accident etc.  However, I wouldn't pay anything yet.  If you were driving the car normailly and were not in an accident that was your fault, then the problem is theres.  They provided a car that wasn't safe or suitable for normal driving.  Depending on what your lawyer says you could tell them you are going to call the police against them and see what they say.  They might back down (again speak to someone who knows if there are any ramifications for this!)  It may also be advantagous to have someone call on your behalf.  There are bound to be some lawyers in here who can give you some quick advice.  All the best, if you need anything please PM me.  Cheers
RE: Do I need a lawyer? Its not your fault you dont have to pay. you only pay if you do an accident. if they provided you with a scarp and it broke its their its their fault. Go to police
RE: Do I need a lawyer? and make sure if you feel that they are going to report you to the police you reach the authorities first else their false claims will get you then and you will have to pay then. if the police cant decide IN YOU FAVOR THEN GO FOR A LAWYER.
RE: Do I need a lawyer? The problem with the replacement car must be serious as the engine brokedown. It maybe by accident then the insurance will take care of it, but if by negligent then someone to pay.. i think no need to find a lawyer just simple as that.
RE: Do I need a lawyer? let them go to the police or to the court as they said,it's better for you since investigation be conducted,then wait and see the results..if you feel that you're not satisfied with the outcome,that's the time you will seek for a legal opinion...am sure you will win this case...its not your liability at all....

Gratuity Payments My co-worker has been working here in Qatar for over 25 years. As per Qatar Law please help me determine the number of weeks he is entitled for his Gratuity payments. I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. Is this correct? Kindly cite the article or law which states it. Thanks.
seems like you read the law, haven't you?? How come you say <b>" I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. Is this correct"</b>  and then you ask the people to cite the article...would rather suggest to you to go back to the law and get it right.  Contact a lawyer for support and guidance or go to the Ministry of Labour for details.  Regards!!!
he is entitled to as i know, he is entitled to receive payment woth 3 weeks per every year starting from the year the law was effective (2003 or 2004 i can't remember) to his last basic salary.    Yalla!
I have read that he is entitled for 6 weeks. I read it in a newspaper article but I couldn't find it in the Labor law. I hope to see written expressly in the labor law. Hope you could help me find it.
If his contract doesn't If his contract doesn't state anything to the contrary, I believe at minimum he is entitled to 3 weeks salary for every year worked = in his case 25 years x 3 weeks = 75 weeks or about 1.5 years last salary (not an average or his original pay but his latest).  However, some employers do state they will pay more than the labour law stipulates.  He should check his contract.  His employer is NOT allowed to pay less than the minimum the labour law has approved. If in doubt or dispute, he should contact a reputable lawyer.  This is a substantial sum of money.  Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"
check article 54, Qatar check article 54, Qatar Labour Law of 2004, it's stated there unless that law doesn't apply to your mate or has been revise, nevertheless you get there your required info.  <BR> ^_^ imho

Win 7 is lighter then Vista...safetier, cooler appearance  But if you're often gear up your laptop performance like me....don't use Win 7 for now...wait untill 1 year to come...still have bunch of problem with compatibility.  Just use Tune Up utility or other apps to speed up your Vista

How is Belgium??? Hi  I am interested in knowing more about Belgium. How is the place? The cost of living compared to other european countries. Are the people there fluent in english? The modes of transportation and areas of tourist interest?  All relevant suggestions welcome.  Thank you .
Belgium has some fantastic Belgium has some fantastic tourist locations that would take maximum 4 days to see if you were on a snail's pace.  Brussels is an awesome city to visit as well as live. I find it as cosmopolitan as Paris or London. Other great cities to visit are Brugge, Ghent and Antwerp. If you want a little seaside action you can head up to Knocke or Blankenberge.  From my experiences as a foreigner in Belgium have been that in the Flemish speaking (Not German, Paul) areas are a little less acceptant of differences in the way people look and will definately stare and ogle.  But in Brussels and its suburbs there is none of that what so ever... and none in the southern French speaking areas really from my experiences.  There are quite a few 'halal' restaurants in Brussels. Particularly between Gare de Midi and the Arab quarter of the city.  They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to see it... --George Carlin
Not everyone would love Not everyone would love brussels , it is a bit old ... u will even find them selling those toys made of wood ... and lots of old stuff ...   The oldest mall " Galleries Royales St-Hubert " and it is a must see ....  also the grand place isnice specialy if they have the flower festival or whatever it is called .  Dont forget to enjoy the chocolat and check the dimonds :)
Belgium is nearer to France Belgium is nearer to France than UK.. Which is very good.  Famous for child sex cases.  They eat Frites.  They drink beer.  Following will hopefully summarise belgiuns..    A Belgian came into a bar and ordered a beer. The waiter put a coaster and a beer on the table.  Ten minutes later the Belgian ordered another beer. The waiter brought him the beer and saw that the coaster had disappeared. So he fetched another one..  Ten minutes later, another beer. And again the coaster was missing. This time the waiter decided he would not lay down another coaster..  - "Hey" the Belgian said, "where's my cookie ?"
correction, Belgium speaks Dutch, not German! The official languages in Belgium are dutch (or Flamish to be accurate)and French. THere is a tiny area where people speak German, but this is not regarded as an official language associated with Belgium.  If you go to the tourist area's (Knokke, Brugge, gent etc) or the big cities like Liege, Antwerp or Brussels you'll be fine.  In the coutry-side or smaller villages people might make foreigners feel ''unwelcome''.  Overall Belgium is a lovely place to visit, great places of sight seeing and amazing food too.

Belgians independence n 1830 the Belgians revolted and declared their independence. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was chosen king in 1831. The Dutch invaded later that year. After years of negotiation, an armistice was arranged. The Treaty of London, signed in 1839, established Belgium as an independent state, whose sovereignty and neutrality were guaranteed by all of the European powers. ----------- smithsan <a href="http://makemoney.bizoppjunction.com" rel="do follow">Make Money</a>

CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION can any one inform me that electronic engineer (B.tech) need to attest his certificate in india before he took any job in qatar. If the person stuided in mumbai where he should attest the copy in delhi or mumbai. if anyone got any idea please inform
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION You need to have the ORIGINALS attested at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Delhi.
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION LP - for Indians we HAVE to attest the ORIGINALS or the MOFA here wont attest them and then cannot prosess visa without MOFA stamp.....
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION In other words, the certificate of an (Indian) university is not trustworthy. I did not know that.
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION Tinkerbell, ANY document, irrespective of nationality, that has been issued outside Qatar, and that needs to be used as an official document in Qatar MUST be authenticated .. Even my undergraduate diploma from the USA has a Qatar Embassy stamp on the original document (not on front of the document).  Qatar Embassy in DC will not stamp on anything but the original certificate.
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION YES U NEED TO ATTEST UR CERTIFICATE...  IT SHOULD BE FROM THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(MEA) and QATAR EMBASSY IN INDIA.
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION Sanchar Deb - I have recently been going thru this process myself in our office for our staff and a colleague of mine - 2 of them in fact - both had only their Xeroxed copies attested first by their embassies and then by MOFA. One is from Pakistan and the other from Sri Lanka.   When another staff from India went for the same procedure he was told to have the originals attested and was also told that this applied only to Indians.   Now who has the right procedure? Cause each time you get conflicting reports on this. There doenst seem to be any concrete rule per se. and honestly it is rather tiring.
RE: CERTIFICATE ATTESTATION Please visit: http://www.education.nic.in/circulars/archival_auth.htm  and  http://www.mea.gov.in/myprint.php?id=8801&d=06&m=&y=&pg=&flg=&searchdata1=  You need to get your degree attested first from State Secretariat at Mumbai, as you have passed your B.Tech from Maharashtra. Then, you will have to get it attested by any Regional Office of Ministry of External Affairs, located in some state capitals and in New Delhi. Upon endorsement by Ministry of External Affairs, just go to Qatar Embassy in India, and get it ratified.  Now, your degree is perfect and you will not face any problem in Qatar for any further ratification from Indian Embassy in Qatar and Ministry of External Affairs of Qatar.

You may test your skills of spotting them right on this thread. Will come in handy laters.

Driving licence Change I am a Korean now working in Qatar i have Qatar ID, i need  to take Qatar driving licence,is it possible to change Korean licence to Qatar.  if any possibilty please give me the direction...
RE: Driving licence Change if u think that u r perfect in driving and no need to take any driving course then u can show your korean license and directly give the test to get qatar driving license.if u dont have any idea about qatar driving then join a short course and try to get it
RE: Driving licence Change I suggest you take a driving class before taking driving test. Most of the guys I know even having a professional drivers license issued from their country of origin fails the driving test (if you did not attended a driving class).
RE: Driving licence Change No driving test is required. It is possible to change South Korean driving license. First you need to translate the license into English either with Embassy or with a recognized translating agency.

Location of GULF HELICOPTER Hello friends,  How do we find the exact route to Gulf Helicopters from Ras Abboud bridge... I know it is on the road, after Marriott and Qatar Aviation college. But not sure about the route to reach the Offices of THALES and GULF HELICOPTERS.  Is it inside the NDIA project office ? Do we need any other details / documents to reach there ?
the Location Marked as A is the Location Marked as A is the gulf helicopters.   Its on the opposite side of marriot hotel a road is going inside taking you directly to the gulf helicopters and parallel to the airport boundry wall.
Gulf Helicopter If ur coming from the airport arrival area, turn right at the bridge, then turn right at the first exit (service road), just go straight about 100 meters, a little left and right again and thats it.
It's the first right turn It's the first right turn (slip road) after ras abou aboud bridge. You have to drive quite a bit to get there.   Use the link below. The map cross-hairs are on the turn off from main road.  http://wikimapia.org/#lat=25.2832421&lon=51.5579742&z=16&l=0&m=b  Get there really early (before 5:30am, regardless of your flight time) if you want to have any chance of finding a parking spot.
How to find a home for three kittens? I am leaving the country soon and would like to give away three kittens that I have been taking care of over the past few years. Their names are "he", "she", and "her" and they are adorable. I need to find them a home before I leave because they will be at great risk if I return them to the street. What is a good way of giving them away?
RE: How to find a home for three kittens? pls pm me..how old r they? i m intrested to see their pictures..
RE: How to find a home for three kittens? What kind of kittens? is that stray cats? can you attached photos? because my daughter she wanted to have one.Is there's any documents needed?  Vipermann
RE: How to find a home for three kittens? The responsibility of pet ownership does not cease when it becomes "inconvenient".  Why don't you take them with you?  All you need is the correct paperwork, a cat carrier or two and the willingness to try.  As for putting them on the street, better they should be euthanized rather than having them starve, get beat up by other cats, run over by a car, or tortured by some of the misguided children.  It's good you're trying to find them a new home, and perhaps your circumstances are such that you really can't take them with you.  But under no circumstances should you put them out to fend for themselves.  Good luck.

Is a 2009 Entertainer in bookstores? Has anyone purchased an Entertainer this year, the book which is full of 2 for 1 vouchers at various sporting and retail outlets in Qatar. Furthermore if you have could you tell me where you purchased it from, and if it still has 2 for 1 vouchers for rounds of golf at Doha Golf Club in it?  Many thanks for your help

Family Visit Visa What are the documents needed (in the Phil) to bring my family(wife and son) here in Qatar for Family Visit visa? Should they come here on visit visa then later when they are here convert to family visit visa? or direct family visit? Please help....i need them to be here on Jan'2011.
well im not really sure about well im not really sure about the salary certificate thing from company coz other people said that they also require bank statement for 3 or 6 months ensuring that your salary cross from 7000 riyals and above. feel free to correct if this wrong. (company contract + salary certificate + bank statement + house rent /elec/water bills)   thats all i know for now. God bless....
Family Visit Visa hi, you can apply here. but some procedures you need to do. 1. you need to have marriage contract and birth cert. of child with red ribbon from DFA Phil. 2. then you need to go bring those documents at Phil. Embassy here in Doha for stamp. 3. then after that you need to go to Ministry of Foreign Affairs for stamp.  4. Now ask your company to process Family Visit Visa for your wife and child.   Hope it helps.  God bless.
tnx cokewh! the red ribbon tnx cokewh! the red ribbon should also be needing stamp from the Phil? or only here in qatar? what about they're passport? a copy only or the original is needed? is that automatic 6 months or renew only monthly when they are here?
it's up to you and your it's up to you and your eligibility to either to bring them on family visit  visa (6 months) or Family/RP visa. If you are eligible,  bring them on Family/RP Visa right away, no need 6 months visit visa. I am not sure about Phils, but here to apply you need their passport copies, copy of your marriage certificate, copy of your kid(s)' Birth certificate(s) -/sometimes these documents must be attested, not always though/- , NOC letter from your sponsor, bank statements. to be eligible to sponsor your family, you have to meet certain requirements (position, salary, etc.) Make Search on QL and you will find a lot of info on this subject

Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? Got a parking ticket for parking opposite the city centre a few weeks back.  I've been checking for offences online but nothing showing up.  How do I pay the fine?
RE: Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? Go to the traffic department kiosk in City Center and settle/pay your parking ticket.  Regards!!
RE: Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? that is 1st warning only...no charge.
RE: Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? Wait till it appears online.  You cannot pay until it appears online.  Sometimes, it takes upto a month to appear online.
RE: Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? just bring the sticker to the MOI kiosk in city center and pay the fine, don't wait for it to appear in the MOI website. and FYI don't wait for 2 months before you pay the fine, someone told me you'll have additional penalty by then
RE: Got a parking ticket - what are the options for paying? So, some conflicting answers there.  Is it a warning or a parking ticket?  Do I pay now or wait?  It's an Oval sticker which is mostly yellow and some black.  All the text/writing is in Arabic.  There is some pen on the sticker which I presume is my licence plate and date etc.

Mumps anyone? A friend of mine currently has 3 boys at home with the mumps. All boys were vaccinated and received their boosters. Currently there is an epidemeic in Ontario Canada where they are doing mass vaccinations at universities, schools, hospitals etc.   Anyone have kids currently with the mumps, or just getting over them? Has anyone gotten them more than once?
Luck by Chance.....precaution is better than..... Doctors recommend but could not give a guarantee, but after immunization, chances are less that you will get sick...BUT chances are there on other side as well.
health Good health will never be realized unless there is good hygiene (nothing about the poor lady with mumpy sons) 1. clean drinking water 2. good sanitation 3. good personal hygiene - washing and no spitting  that may explain partly why immunised people still get TB
mumps... goodness, got that when I was 19 my neck swelled so much, I looked like a cobra... wasn't pleasant....  <p> &quot;if you don't like the heat... get out of the kitchen... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave... it will burn you on the a** as you go through the doorway....&quot; ME  </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>visit www.qaws.org
mumps I wonder if perhaps the vaccine they got as babies was somehow a bad batch and therefore did not adequately protect the children.  And I completely disagree with the vaccinations are stupid remark.  Vaccinations have saved millions of lives.
DeeDee, if a baby or child's DeeDee, if a baby or child's immune system is not developed enough to be able to process the antibodies inside a vaccination then it is pointless and stupid.  Now if we are to discuss the meaning of this word vaccinate then what is being done is not vaccination as by definition a vaccination is to inoculate with a vaccine to produce immunity.   It is proven that this is not being done. How is it that 20% of TB cases in Qatar had been 'vaccinated' and received boosters?  They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to see it... --George Carlin

How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? Please can you give me some information about the life of a teacher in Qatar. How much salary does one gets. What usually is the package and offer does the company gives? Thanks
RE: How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? It depends on the school and the level of your education.   Normally it starts from QR 2500/- up to QR 10000/- with respect the scools and subject.  But you can take tutions which will help you to sustain here.
RE: How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? well it all depends on the school you work, the grade you teach for and your qualification and experience. Please be specifice in all your quistions if some one has to help you. The suggestion of taking tution is really bad  most of the teachers in india seem to be so vague in class and that makes kids go for tution. The teachers must be ASHAMED  as they dont do their job sincerly though  the parents pay so much as school fee and you teachers  dont teach properly to gain students for tution. These teachers must be sacked
RE: How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? depends on the school and your experience if your applying locally but if your applying through agency then expect lower.
RE: How much is the salary for teachers in Qatar? if u coming from abroad u get over 12,500riyals per month + accommodation include and a free loan for a car  but is u get employ as a local teacher ur salary would be between 5,000 to 8,000 per month if u lucky without any benefit or whatsoever
Who is an expat? Hi All, I noticed that people selling their cars say that they are "expat" or "expat car".  Well, what does that mean?  Do "expat cars" bring more value than local folks' cars.  I know expat take care of their cars and spend money on it.  But, really .. who is an expat.  To me .. when I read the advert, I expect an native english speaker or europeans.  Is that so? or expat is just everyone who is not local?
In its broadest sense, an In its broadest sense, an expatriate is any person living in a different country from where he or she is a citizen. In common usage, the term is often used in the context of professionals sent abroad by their companies, as opposed to locally hired staff (who can also be foreigners). The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors, so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates, whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant'.  WIKI Dixit!
Anyone who is not a Anyone who is not a local..  by the way, beware of expats selling Dacias.
expatriates are also commonly expats are also commonly referred to as the infidels so the term expat is used only to soften the advertisement.  an advert saying "infidel wanting to sell car" wouldn't bring many responses i would imagine.
...Very good question. ...Very good question. Commonly, I see most of Qataris by expat they mainly mean Westerners, by residents they mean Arabs, by laborers them mean communities from certain countries.   When the Arab "expat" holds dual nationality, they point it out as a privilege. Who am I exactly in all of that, I have no clue.   Signed by: Laborer under the Labor Law of Qatar.
Expat is the one who is Expat is the one who is neither here nor there...neither X nor Y. He is an 'ex' for his home country and doesnt get any 'pat' from his adopted country.

Expat are non locals .. yeah right .. Expat are non locals.. Yeah right.. Not all of them.  To the locals, expats mean westerners.  Especially, white folks.  If you are an Arab with a westerner nationality, you are still called an arab with a westerner nationality.  That is true for Indians, Pakis,...etc. I think historically, the British expats who were here in the early days (70s, 80s) were a true representation of expats.  However, this has changed a lot through our the years.  I think the term "expats" now apply to a wider group of people. Anyway, all expats are welcome as they as they understand the culture. One sad thing though, is the separation between expats and locals.  There is a boundary and low engagement.  That is why those terms will still have a meaning.  I am really looking for that day, when this term "the way it means today" disappears!

A good offer for Job Grade 7?? I recently got a job offer from Qatar Airways. A total salary package of 13,800.00:  Basic 9000.00 Housing 3500.00 Transportation 1000.00 Utilities 300.00   Is this a good offer for Job Grade 7??
Hi This isnt a very high offer neither a very low offer. If you are married and having kids you may find it difficult to run with your salary, specially the housing cost is very high here, and you will have to bear the school fees as well. you can just have a room for 3500qr. But If you hope to live alone you will be able to save some money. I wish you all the best!

IKEA?? Hey guys..  im moving to Qatar in a few months. Is there an IKEA there? where do people usually get furniture from?
RE: IKEA?? i dont live in Doha right now. Coming frm India. So is there an IKEA there?
RE: IKEA?? No IKEA yet--although one is expected to open within a year.  Most places come furnished, but there are a number of furniture stores around--some boutique, others general department store types.  Generally the quality and range of choice is not comparable to Europe or America.  Mattresses are particularly limited.
RE: IKEA?? thanks frenchieman.. u seem to be quite the man here on QL.

What one thing would do differently? This is aimed at ex-pats already living in Qatar.  I am moving out in early October and would like to ask, what one thing you would do differently (if you had your time again) regarding your move?  All help is much appreciated.  Thanks  Scott
wish to be 10 years younger ..
What a nice way to frame the What a nice way to frame the question. Thought provoking too.  I haven't been here long enough, but I don't regret anything about moving here. Before coming here I looked up and read a lot about Qatar and the social scene(QL was a big part of getting info). Even when you come here, take your time when deciding where you want to stay. Get a feel of the place and neighborhood. Move around in places you might enjoy (malls, Souq, Katara, go to the orchestra etc), and choose which hangout you like best enough to be frequent in.   Is there any particular thing you are concerned about during this move?  All the best.
i wouldn't have moved! i wouldn't have moved!
training courses: i wish that training courses: i wish that i have made more before coming here coz here it is costlier and no free time for it.
Nothing to be scared of. Nothing to be scared of. Qatar is a great place. The only thing I would have done differently is to ask that the company provide family housing, rather than having to find it myself.
Get any documents that you Get any documents that you will need (police clearance certificate, marriage certificate etc) attested before you move out. You can do it from here but it's more hassle.   Also, set up any savings accounts, ISAs etc you think you may need as once you're out here you'll be unable to set stuff up as an expat.  On top of that, if you have a shipping allowance bring as much as you can - particularly boks, CDs, DVDs etc. I brought just a couple of boxes and have since had to buy stuff which I had left in storage at home.

Single You may have set out to have a laugh but why post about a strip club in a forum that is based in a very religious and conservative country? A bit of a stupid thing to do.   No, there are no strip clubs here or lap top dancers. There are some very nice bars and restaurants and dive clubs and people that meet from here. You may want to try doing that.    I will hoist that up the flag pole and see who salutes it!!

Popcorn person, I come across as being an idiot? I am not the one calling names on an anonymous internet website.  If you don't have any helpful advice I suggest you don't bother responding to my posts as it makes YOU come across as rather rude and ugly individual.
Why can't we have a strip Why can't we have a strip club in Doha. Surely we can! Only the strippers will have to be female monkeys instead of humans.

Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation Hi All I am joining QF in IT Div and as per offer, they will provide me 1 BHK - Fully Furnished accomodation. Anybody has any idea about QF Housing Facilities?
RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation YES THEY HAVE  FULL COLONY OF  VILLAS AND APPARTMENTS U'LL SURELY GET ONE
RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation hi, you are very lucky!  Can you help me find a teaching job or office work at qatar foundation please, thanks  blandz
RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation they have their separate colony which includes, swimming pool,gym, etc. good one.
RE: Housing Facility in Qatar Foundation Their Housing/other facilities are very good...but if the job is in IT, you have to be cautious before taking the offer.  They recently (8 months back)outsourced their IT to EDS, so there are very less 'direct hires' to QF in IT.  Even if you get hired, there is no gaurantee that you will have a job as they are very keen on Outsourcing and other important factor is the Qatarisation.  Please check with the HR/Hiring Managers on these anc make sure you have a clear understanding of the road ahead before jumping in.

Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? Hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries? incl. dog collars, dog bed, bowls?
RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? I have found it rather hit or miss to find good quality dog toys/treats/medicines/dog beds.  I have found that I can order many of these on line and have them shipped here (hey, my dog is worth every Riyal).    http://www.dog-beds-n-beyond.com/coolaroodogbed.html is a website with a description and picture if you're interested.  Shop around, prices do vary.  I have also bought frontline and preventic collars to help prevent tick infestations on line.  hope this helps.
RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? As a continuation of my previous post, you can find somethings here, the prices can be more expensive (or less so when you take into consideration shipping etc.)  However, the bed is something I've never seen here.  I like it because it keeps the dog off the floor, easy on the joints - my dog is older, and cooler as the air circulates around it.  It is also easy to clean/wash and dries quickly.
RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? I think u'll get some in Hyatt plaza, its not complete but they do sell stuffs there at a reasonable price.
RE: Any info on where to get dog accessories in qatar? <p>Yes, go to souq wakef, the place where they sale animal. its a nice shop where you can find everything you need for your dog even cloths.</p>
Is it a good salary? Hi there,  I got an offer to move to Qatar from US I currently have a good position in a good institution I've 8 years experience. The offer is around QAR45k/month with other perks.  How good it is?  How does it in Qatar in terms of negotiating higher salaries? It's hard to find resources related to Salaries in Qatar ...  Thanks ya'll
Very good offer.. Very good offer..
compare If you convert 45k to US dollars and you earn almost the same amount, then you better stay in the US. If not, don't hesitate, move to Qatar.  I have nothing against Qatar because the locals are now very adaptable people especially if you work in a well sought company. In fact you might probably feel that other arabs are more up to themselves. The way people drive there is crazy though. No discipline and road rage is massive! I had lived in Qatar for x amount of years so I know what it's like.  I will come back definitely...my passive lifestyle suits me to be there. good luck!
You really would have to give You really would have to give us an idea of the job and the company in order for us to answer that. It varies widely with position. Mandi
US citizen Yes It seems very strange for a US citizen to ask such questions in a forum - As Mandilulur said without giving any idea about the job or his qualifications or any details - this looks to be a fake !
You Get Approx 12000USD and You Get Approx 12000USD and thats Quite Suffucient
Ya, good offer. Ya, good offer.
Bill Gates will only laugh Bill Gates will only laugh about this salary!
Is this a show off? Or are Is this a show off? Or are you dump to know 12000 USD pm is too low?
no its not enough don't come no its not enough don't come here.
I'll take half of that and will remain in the US.
Not only that, Mandi. The Not only that, Mandi. The replies also depend on where each individual poster is coming from. Generally, for Asians, QR45k is a lot but not so for some others. But QR45k all inclusive? Should also take into account the budget busters esp. accomodation.    Comingtoqatar - you can do a search on QL for your concerns and then ask specific questions if you still haven't found what you want to know and you might get some answers.   Btw, we're all volunteers, not people connected with the govt tourism or anything so pls don't be discouraged if you don't get proper answers sometimes. I say this cos there have been many times in the past where newbies ask questions and expect answers and get upset when there aren't any useful ones and then blame the QL site owners.
thanks gain No it's not fake! But I think I got a good idea on how to approach it from this threads and others. It's a very active forum by the way!
How much do you think you How much do you think you deserve?

Parking Ticket Can someone tell me where can I go and pay a parking ticket I got near the City Center Mall?
RE: Parking Ticket CLEAR YOUR QUESTION
RE: Parking Ticket Number 1. It must be by credit card.  Number 2. If there are no points associated with the ticket then you can pay on line.  Number 3. If there are points then you must go to one of the police stations... Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa, Airport Traffic on Tadmur and E Ring or one of the kiosks at the airport and I think some of the malls.  good luck  On #3 that may only be for cars that the sponsors own, if it is your personal vehicle and your Qatar license is is tied to the vehicle then you may be able to pay on line. But company cars cannot because they don't know whom to assign the points to.
RE: Parking Ticket Parking tickets usually have points (don't ask me why, they just do).  So you likely need pay in person.  Since you got it near City Center, easiest would be the MoI kiosk on the ground floor of CC, just under Carrefour.  Bring your credit or debit card (no cash) and your Drivers License.
Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? Is anybody tried to use International driver's license here in Doha? Or do we need to take a half course of driving lesson to get a driver's license?
RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? I second what "UkEngQatar" says above, and will add that the car rental stations at the airport told me that it is only valid for your 1st 7 days upon arrival in Qatar.
RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? Please note, that an International Driving License is NOT a license - it is a translation of the license you currently hold - therefore it is not valid unless you also have your usual license. An international license is issued to simplify things for the licensing authorities in the country you are going to wish to drive in - all it does here in Qatar is speed up the conversion process.   The 7 day rule applies to certain nationalities that are permitted to drive here without having to retake their test - providing they enter with a tourist visa - an international license will not help you in this instance,  you must always show your original license - if anyone has found this to be different then I will be surprised.   And for those nationalities where a re-test is required here, an IL will not help - I believe you just have to grin and bear it and re-take the test again.
RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? International Driving license is valid for 6 months from the date of entry in Doha, provided that you dont have RP here.  I'm here on visit visa and driving on International license. Even I had an accident last month and I presented my International License with my passport to the Police officer at Maroor Traffic Police, and they accepted it. So, don't worry and go ahead.
RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? thanks for the information....highly appreciated..
RE: Is International Driver's License valid here in Doha? you can use it until you get your ID after its useless... Good Luck

Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as consumer? I'm a first timer, and I'm still thinking of what carrier should I choose when buying a phone.  Things that I'm looking after are, cost of call, sms, International (Canada, Manila and Singapore).  Are there Prepaid and Postpaid subscription as well?  What can you say? Muchas Gracias,
RE: Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as... There are a lot of choices in Qatar. Both postpaid and prepaid are available. Virgin Mobile is prepaid only.  If you are looking for the best network, you want to buy Shari (postpaid), Hala (prepaid) or Virgin Mobile. All of these give you the Qtel network, which has much better coverage.  If you are looking for the best experience (buying, customer care, support, ...) then go with Virgin Mobile.  If you are looking for the lowest price, postpaid is cheaper if you expect to use the number of minutes that come with the Qtel or Vodafone bundles.  If you also expect to use the phone overseas or to call overseas, then things get complicated, because there are so many promotions lately.
RE: Which is better Vodafone, Qtel or Virgin Mobile as... Currently, Vodaphone and Virgin mobile are new and trying to capture market by their attractive rates. But in reality, their reception quality is very bad indeed because they are building their sites yet.  So in this situation, QTEL is best or if you want to avail their packages, buy any cheap mobile set and use their SIM on that phone for only out going.

Will Visa be provided in A4 sheet Hi ,  I recently got an offer with malomita through i2sbs.  I was asked to submit my passport and they said that i will be receiving my visa in a A4 sheet. And after reaching qatar only i will be getting my visa stamped in passport is that true??  Please advise...  Thanks, Praveen.
As meteris stated, company As meteris stated, company will apply for visa. It can take 2-3 days, but don't be surprised if it stretches to 2-3 weeks.
sound right You will be sent usually, by email a pdf copy of the Work Visa, when you arrive you show immigration along with your passport, they will give you a normal arrivals stamp in your passport one and also a stamp saying you should report to expatriate affairs within 1 month. Once you arrive, you will be blood typed, tested, x-rayed and have your finger prints taken and then once you have passed all of that your sponsor will apply for the residents permit which is a passport size sheet stuck in the passport, which states your occupation and visa type.
Hi ...Thanks for the Hi ...Thanks for the update....And i also i havent filled any visa application form i have only signed and sent my offer letter...Is that enough for visa processing becuase the consultancy did not ask much only my certificates softcopy they took.....Is that ok for processing?
should be that's all they took for me, you may need some verification of the certificates by the embassy here to confirm they haven't been forged. You sponsor needs to apply for a visa for a certain position and nationality before you can get your work permit, so they will have that and your quals and nationality should match.
you dont need to sign any you dont need to sign any visa application form.
Thanks Hi thanks for the update both of you...One more small clarification how many days will it take for the PDF visa to be processed????
no idea on that no idea on that

Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Hi,  We were lookig for a dog/puppy for our family and that is when we came to see Europuppy in the internet. I would like to know if anyone in Qatar have tried to buy from Europuppy. Is it safe to purchase a pet online? What about the safety of the animal? The prices they have mentioned seem to be reasonable. Please do reply, if anyone have had a satisfied experience from Europuppy.
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Why don't you come down to QAWS and have a look at all the abandoned and homeless animals that need a home instead of buying one from another country. There are far too many dogs and puppies in Qatar that need a good home.  Please be advised that if you do get a dog online, you have to be careful as you might not get the dog you ask for, it may be sick and you have no idea of the temperment.  There isn't anywhere that can guarentee the reputation of Europuppy as it is an internet based shop. They do not breed the puppies but find them around Europe so you don't know how they've been kept and how the mothers are treated. You also won't be able to get a puppy under the age of 16 weeks as it is illegal to import a puppy younger then that into Qatar.
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Chelsea, i am looking forward to go to QAWS this weekend with my family. I am just checking for an option incase I dont get a small breed. Because I had viewed the qaws site and dogs in doha site, all had medium to large dogs(I love big dogs, have two GSDs in my hometown but space prblms as discussed b4). I am not yet taking a decision, but checking out my options. I just want to know how trustworthy it can be, bcos the prices are too low which gives a doubt and just curious to know if someone from Qatar has actually tried it out.
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? I always thought that europuppy is maybe a puppy mill because you only get to contact one guy and he'll get the dog for you and puppy mills dogs will only be sick and costing you more then what you paid for! and not to mention encouraging his business  you should adopt a dog from qaws they usually have small breed dogs every now and then and speaking of which! I just found a small breed dog couple of hours ago but I really needs to search for the owner before giving him away!!
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? I have purchased my dog from europuppy.  They are safe to deal with.  Doha vets have dealt with them many times for importing dogs.
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? On-line long-distance pet offers are quite often scams. They will claim the puppy is a very low price or even free and then will charge you up-front for shipping and guess what -  no dog!
RE: Has Anyone heard about Europuppy? Be very careful about buying animals unseen.  Far better to buy from a breeder known to a trusted friend who can see the animal for you. Puppies, especially those from puppy farms, are very stressed by transport and liable to succumb to various illnesses such as parvovirus if not fully and correctly vaccinated.  I do not know Europuppy but I have heard too many sad stories of sick and dying imported animals.  Check with the local vets and welfare people to see whether they can make any recommendations.  Also, do not forget that there are various conditions applied for the transport of animals by air and for import to Qatar.

Shipping of Car/Vehicle to Qatar I am buying a second hand car from Cyprus and they are shipping it here with the police clearance from Cyprus. I just would like to know whether i need something from customs, MOI or any government facility here before i can register it to my name.  Thanks
Better check with the traffic Better check with the traffic police( Better meet the captain). You may get the car into Qatar but it might not registered for road usage in Qatar.   Don't quote me on this.
Call Custom Better than calling Police, please call the Qatari Customs, I have experience in that already. If the car is older than XX number of years, they will not allow it.
Thanks for the reply. It is Thanks for the reply. It is 2010 model, so I presume it's only 3 years or below.
Importing Cars Hi, pay attention to importing, these are most likely scams, usual blather about moving, money wrong side of the road..............if its too good to be true, generally it isnt, best of luck D
Thanks syed and Daniel. Thanks syed and Daniel. Exactly same wordings /she used in her post.
It's a scam Avoid this, there are at least two ads in QL for cars like this, for the fun of it I kept emailing the guy who uses a Western Expat name, when he said the car is not registered in Cyprus I.e. has no title I knew it was a scam. Also their insistence on using the shipping company was another tell, I've brought cars from the US before and the process is straight forward, but unless you have the title then good luck. Be careful people...

Super Humid dito lately! Super Humid dito lately! kakaligo mo lang, malagkit na skin mo ulit :) yun lang. Pero if your company will process your plane ticket dito tapos ramadan pa starts on the 22nd, baka tamarin na sila. LOL. pero nun dumating ako dito Oct. 9 eh, on-going ramadan pa at agency rin ako. yun ticket naman eh E-Ticket na rin lahat. mga 1 day process lang yun ng company mo. tapos print mo lang, ayos na. :D  sana hindi buwaya agency mo at baka humingi ng processing fee tapos placement fee pa sa unang sweldo mo sa Doha. Tsk tsk. nag PDOS ka na ba?
saka na daw po pdos saka na daw po pdos pagdating nung authentication from embassy e....sana nga po company job ako e kaso po personal driver po ako kaya sa bahay at office lang nung sponsor ko ang ruta ko huhuhu....me babayran na po ako dito sa pinas poea processing then yung medical ko then 1 month salary for placement fee sana nga po wala na kong bayaran diyan...   I know God has a good plan for me and my family...
harharharharhar... akala ng harharharharhar... akala ng mga driver sa pinas madali makapasa sa driving test/exam kung hindi mag-aral harharharharhar... subukan nyo nalang para malaman nyo sinasabi ko bwehehehehehe
yah sir i know that its very yah sir i know that its very hard to get a license there in qatar...and i am already search that and still keeping asking guidelines and  tips thats why im very nervous regarding getting drivers license there in qatar...  hindi ko naman po nasabing madali kumuha ....naicomment ko lang po na ang sabi po e di na ko mag aaral dahil me license nako pero sa totoo lang po gusto kong mag aral at kung gagastusan lang po ako ng employer ko sa pag aaral ng driving e lubos ko pong ikakatuwa...and i keep on praying for that  anyway thanks for all your comments...

hey hey. enough of these hey hey. enough of these arguments. Qatar doesn't honor philippine driver's license and not automatically having Qatar Driver's License. Although, you will still take 12 days driving lessons and to pay at least QR 1,150 for the lessons.   Note: sorry admin and mods for not ispokening in inglish :)
Not sure. But if youre going Not sure. But if youre going thru an agency in the Philippines like what happened to me, it will take at least 1 month of waiting. But in Doha, based on the processing of our PRO in the office, it only takes a week or less. Even for visa renewal, in one week i can have the original I.D. :)
Also, Before you get the Also, Before you get the visa in Doha. if you're in doha already, if you have gone to Blood testing and finger printing, that's the only time you can have your Visa. :)
authentication in the authentication in the embassy usually takes a week, done thru DHL.. im not sure though if it's the same with working visa, coz in our case, it was a visit visa and it only took a week.. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Misc/Smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gif" title="MySpace Comments" border="0"></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingchees
a week only yah, it takes a week only..same with mjamille :)
yup i pay 750 pesos for the yup i pay 750 pesos for the authentication in the embassy but i don't know if in 750 pesos already include my dhl courier fee... thanks for all the reply.. i hope to work there as soon as possible but i remember it is already ramadan next week .. maybe its hard to work there in ramadan   I know God has a good plan for me and my family...
so maybe i have to wait for so maybe i have to wait for almost 1 month before i will fly to qatar ?? maybe after ramadan ??    I know God has a good plan for me and my family...
Fast Processing Authentication in the Qatar Embassy of your Visa would only take a week...mabilis na lang yan.... After which it depends kung gaano kabilis ang company mo dito sa qatar mag-book ng flight for you!!! Then....WELCOME TO QATAR...

look to your right over there on your screen look at QATAR GUIDE in blue.  Click on the second line--Qatar schools database.   Lots of schools listed with their contact info.  Good luck.  Unfortunately the Canadian School is not highly regarded.
Certificate attestation Hi.. Can any one tell me which agency is doing Certificate attestation.. in my company thet are asking for attesed college certificate
usually done by your embassy?  you need to prove that your certificate is real, not fake.  So i think your embassy has to approve it.
Umm Presumably you're Indian. The Indian Cultural Centre will do that for you as well, if you're worried about the long queues at the Indian Embassy.
Oh But it depends upon if you've got it notarized and attested in India already. Only then will the ICC do it here. They will get the CID approval as well. You will only need to go to the MOFA, which is behind Al Bustan hotel and get it attested.
never heard of any company never heard of any company demanding for attested documents !
Mubarak's faith in Egyptian healthcare... If the president of a country has to be treated for  gallstone removal (not that difficult) in another another country (Germany), this does not say much for  Egyptian healthcare or does it instill a great amount of confidence in your own countrys ability to perform such procedures. What does this have to say about Egyptian trained providers? Mubarak himself shows the way to go -  EVASIVE ACTION !

from hairdresser to secretary is anyone here knows if it is possible to change my visa and company from being hairdresser to secretary? i am planning to buy my NOC from my present company and planning to move to a new and more decent job which is secretary but i heard that it is not possible to change my profession, is it true? please help me
You can BUY an NOC? You can BUY an NOC?
The position stated in your visa is based on the availability of visa allowance given to your current sponsor/employer by the Ministry.   You are planning to buy your contract from your sponsor so they could give you the NOC AND LOOK FOR a secretarial job?   Your job must be paying so well...
buying any documents is buying any documents is illegal. If your current sponsor is willing to provide a NOC, you can cancel your RP, exit Qatar, and come back on the new work visa with the new job title, provided by the new sponsor.
Certainly yes When we have housewives through the influence of their husbands or others working as customer service representatives, sales representatives, etc in banks, companies,Malls and others then I dont see why you cannot change your profession provided your sponsor gives you a NOC (and thats what we call the magic document)
@shaina yes dear you can change your Job title.

Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Hello friends,  I want to buy some toys for my small kitten. I saw few toys at Qatar Vet Center but I found them very costly. Can anyone suggest me the place from where to buy? Also please suggest what I can buy for her to make her playful.  Thanks, Hemali
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require yeah, it was a problem for me too, until last summer when i went back home for vacation. I brought from there some stuff  for my kitty, all for $1 :) I would love to share it with you, but some of them were given away right upon my arrival back in Doha, some of them got lost, some of them are not in a good condition. Currently my Cookie is playing with the Christmas tree balls, and she is sooo happy with them! She has emptied half of my Christmas tree (helped me to unload it for packing till the next Christmas), all the bottom of the tree is balls-free.. you can find balls everywhere: in the kitchen, under the bed, behind the couches, in my shoes.. she loves rolling them all over..
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require thanks for replying...  Friends, I need more suggestions and place details.
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Cats always love playing with a piece of string - you keep hold of one end a wiggle it across the flor.
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Hemal... I agree with Mandi.  you shuld collect the small plastic papers, which is covered on the cookies... make it in different shape.... atach to a stich with a pin....... and show to the kitten  see the fun.. i have lots of video in my camera kitten playing  the shape and the mild noice of plastic paper, really arouse the scientist within the Kitten ....!!! ..LOL
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Please DO NOT leave your kitten alone with any toys that have string on them and never give them toys that are small enough to fit in their mouths.  The best cheap toys for kittens are:  Ping Pong Balls (QR15 for 30 at Carrefour) Empty Toilet Roll Tubes Balls of Tin Foil Childrens Wind Up Toys (they love to chase them!!) Laser Beeem (bee shaped laser pen cat toy QR30 from ShopRite) Socks
RE: Toys for Kitten..Suggestion require Thanks to all of you for the answers...

RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? sorry... but if you are asking for a private ambulance... to compare with....   only one ambulance will come to you incase of any trouble. only hamad hosp ambulance, they have a complete equipment to take of you. ... there is also qatar red crescent. who works not for 24/7 duty. but they will be available in some events.... like sports event.... and of course they are visible in sealine resort every weekend.  ... some other clinic or hospital has a ambulance but they don't cater a call from 999. if i'm not mistaken... only for a private calls.  good luck
RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? +1 for Samya
RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? We don't have private "Ambulance Services" in Qatar... In case of emergency, just call 999, and they'll dispatch HMC's ambulances.
RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? HMC.. 999
RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? I guess, there are private ambulances with American Hospital, Doha Clinic Hospitals etc...but i dont think any can reach you as fast as HMC's. Moreover, i doubt, no other ambulances are allowed to run thur the red traffic light other than HMCs ambulance. Emergency number is 999
RE: What is the best ambulance service in Doha? ....well just for your info. if qatar red crescent has a priority patient. they can run thru the red light also. but that is case to case basis. ... qatar red crescent ambulance are a big help for the hamad hosp., but if a house to hospital patient.... i guess the HMC will be the right to call.  good luck

Transfer visa from family to work Is it better to transfer from family to work visa? I got a job offer from Barwa and it includes work visa. Presently, I'm under the sponsorship of my husband. Please reply to enlighten me.. Thanks.

RE: Can a Foreigner  (Muslim)  marry Qatari Woman ? Sponsorship law gets nod Web posted at: 2/27/2009 3:38:52 Source ::: THE PENINSULA By MOBIN PANDIT and MOHAMMED SALEM   DOHA: Qatar yesterday issued a new sponsorship law that retains salient features of the previous legislation, which was enforced some 45 years ago.   ...........  The new law (No. 4 of 2009) regulating the entry, exit, residence and sponsorship of foreigners was ratified by the Heir Apparent H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and will be enforced with immediate effect.   Qatari women married to foreigners will be allowed to sponsor their husbands and children.   ...........
RE: Can a Foreigner  (Muslim)  marry Qatari Woman ? Non-muslim men  cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty, this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children, that's why u get married, in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing, the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult! proceed carefully!
Driving in Qatar I have Indian international driving license. can I temporally drive in Qatar using my international driving license?
RE: Driving in Qatar An international driving licence can only be used for seven days after arriving in Qatar.
RE: Driving in Qatar thnks for ur replys.. now i am confused getting both answers..where i can contact officially to confirm it
RE: Driving in Qatar International license can only be used for the first seven days... During this period you can apply with the traffic department and get a temporary license... If you are going to have an RP, then once you get your RP then apply for the permanent license...   Call 180 to get the contact no for the traffic department...
RE: Driving in Qatar As i heard you can drive but it's not safe, one of my friend was caught and fined for that, he is from Australia, better to apply Qatari Liscense to avoid such complications.....Cheers
RE: Driving in Qatar NO, U CANT DRIVE, QATAR HAS AN TEMPARORY LICENSE PROCEDURE,YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT,  SOME GULF LICENSE WILL HELP IN MAKE SUCH LICENSE, BUT INDIAN LICENSE WILL NOT HELP.

Avery Labels I am looking for an Avery labels, I wonder if anyone know where could I buy them.  Many thanks...CRM
haven't seen them in Jarir I've looked several times but haven't seen them there.  Has anyone actually seen them?
Modern Home now call them Modern Home now call them selves 51 East are the sole agents for Avery check with them  nq
thanks, nqatar Where is Modern Home?
Agree with asiha Office 1 - Agree with asiha Office 1 - is the place I bought laser lables for a seminar from them. They on left side on salwa road if you leaving doha - beyond ramada i think.
I bought some labels at the I bought some labels at the bookstore near the Burger King R/A but not the Avery's one. It was my first time there and they have few selection of things, I was kind of in a rush when I went there but will try to come back again and see what exactly they have.
I was there on Wednesday as well, DavidJM The selection is actually pretty good.  I was looking at the labels that are 10 to a sheet - large enough for decent nametags.  I can't remember what the per-sheet price was, but the entire box (1000 labels total) was either 45QR or 55QR.    Assuming I have all the numbers right - and assuming that they work in a printer as well as the name-brand labels, that makes them significantly less expensive than even the Office Max brand labels in the U.S.  I think I'll give them a try!
Avery Labels Breaking news! Avery Labels available at the small stationery shop beside Olympic Sports on Airport Road :o)  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"
They are a brand of office They are a brand of office labels from (I think) the U.S.  They come in every size and shape imaginable - from address labels to full-page labels to small circles.  They're always high quality and can be put through a laser or inkjet printer.
Not the best selection in Not the best selection in the world, but there is a choice. Best of all, they have my favourite CD/DVD labels that cover the whole disc (tiny centre hole only) :o) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"
ok, thanks baldrick2dogs! ok, thanks baldrick2dogs!
pretty sure they're not here I haven't seen any Avery labels. . .and I've definitely looked.  Hopefully someone will have a better answer for you.    There is a bookstore near the Burger King R/A - the one that sells toys, dates, computers, office supplies along with a pathetic book selection - where you can find labels of different sizes that are sold by the sheet.  It could be worth a look, but don't expect to find a huge selection.  Sorry!
Many thanks will try to come Many thanks will try to come and have a look tomorrow...
If I am not mistaken Modern Home is sole agent for both software and labels. They promoted these labels once by conducting seminar in Movenpick  Good luck
I think Office One near I think Office One near Midmac roundabout has them. Aisha-Taweela

to re-gift or not? do you find it tacky or practical to recycle unused,unopened gifts and give them to other people?i would really love to know your opinions about this matter. thanks.
I am a proud regifter!! You just have to be savvy enough to not regift the thing to the person who gave it to you initially.  Sounds easy enough, but when you've been stashing things in your closet for 12 months, you kind of forget where and who they came from!  My theory is that it's better those gifts go to someone else who might actually use and appreciate them than to sit unused in my spare bedroom for months on end.  And my friends and I usually have a Chinese gift exchange around the holidays, and that's an absolutely perfect opportunity for everyone to get rid of those types of items.  And some folks walk away really loving the new item they picked up!  "Most plain girls are virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise." -- Maya Angelou
tacky. If you give it to tacky. If you give it to somebody who knows the person who gave it to you.
It's practical, but i do not It's practical, but i do not do that. I always keep in mind the thought that the giver had on giving the gift to me, and that alone makes the gift a treasure to me.  <I> Mind your own business, then you will see the joy coming into your life.
im quite sentimental..so i im quite sentimental..so i wouldnt give them away. i think its okay if you give them to people who matter to you and who really likes the object ure giving away as oppose to just giving them to just whoever or worse selling them out. ^^
well its ok to regift but imagine u re-gift  something to the same person who gifted it u . lol
lol. quite an interesting lol. quite an interesting thought..yeah coz he must like it coz he gave it to you.

New Hotel I went for a walk around Aspire Park this morning and noticed some new construction where I parked.  Anyone know anything about the new Aspire Hotel? i.e. will it have a bar so we can excercise then have a refreshing drink afterwards?
I dont know wether you have I dont know wether you have heard it ... but the torch building supposed to be converted to office blocks and a hotel.   Maybe now they start doing the work ... 2 years after the game ...
I heard about that one 2 I heard about that one 2 years ago too! The new building is right around the back of the complex. The architects drawing looks very nice :o) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/2847916040/" title="_MG_9382 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3215/2847916040_826cbe2aa0_m.jpg" width="240" height="119" alt="_MG_9382" /> Did you Google it first?

If I lost my cat, how can i find her? I have this persian cat that lived with me for over 7years, and after we moved out the house, I placed her only for a night in our neighbours. The next day I came and my cat was gone. Shes been away for past 4 days now. I hope no1 took her and sell her. Shes a female gray perian cat, without a tail.  So how can I find her? Any Ideas?
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? You can try to post a bulletin in Family Food and Mega Mart.
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? I think its better to get a new one rather than waisting ur time.......n  its jst a pet u have lost....hope u havent lost any human..........n if soo it would be easy to find a human.........
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? Let QAWS know in case someone has rescued her. Put up posters around the neighborhood with her picture. Contact the veterinarians in Doha to be on the lookout for her. A persian without a tail should be distinctive.
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? She is probably at or around your old house. I recommend you go around there and call for her. Leave a trapping cage with food.
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? where is the pic. go to AlMeera and Mall stick pic there on ad board with your detail, or try newspaper Gulftimes.
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? I believed your cat is also looking at YOU, both of you are seemed lost in LOVE... Go back to your old place where the cat used to live. Goodluck !!! Salamat Po...
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? dear friend,  1)You put an advertisement in Television  2)You can arrange an enquiry commission 3)Put an advertisement in Gulf Times with photo
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? I guess your cat had a lover at your previous house ;)  Cats are programmed to find their old homes, have a look at your old place.
RE: If I lost my cat, how can i find her? You can buy a new Persian male cat. then give/show her photo am damn sure he wil find out her with few weeks.

Nokia N900 Compatible with prepaid Hala Hi:  Does anyone know if Nokia N900 is compatible with prepaid Hala.I recently purchased this set and cannot seem to recharge my Hala balance using this phone. Everytime I punch in *127#secret no.# I get a message saying incorrect number. Same holds for checking balance i.e., *129#. Seems the phone does not performm this function.  Has anyone else encountered the same?  Thanks.
i was supposed to buy that i was supposed to buy that also last week but changed my mind when the sales man from Nokia itself told me that the balance inquiry for Qtel doesn't work for N900. said its because the OS of N900 is Linux which is incompatible to that of Qtel's
shouldnt it be *127*secret shouldnt it be *127*secret number#?  Good Fortune always comes knocking at your door...when you are sh*tting in the toilet!! :) <p> _[]~<strong></strong>~[]_  </p><p> <img src="http://www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif"
update for that is coming update for that is coming soon..
I got a N900.You should I got a N900.You should exclude * & #.To check balance you must call 129 and to recharge you must call 127.You cant send credit.
Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new landcruiser? Well iv heard lots of things about the kn filter and thought i might get one installed in my 2009 VXR for about 500QR.  Just wanted to ask existing users, is it a good thing to buy?  I mean i know that it improves the hp, accelleration..blah blah..  BUT is it worth buying?  and Is the improvement recognisable?
RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... First-It will not boost your horspower or acceleration anything considerable-if you where racing and a 1/100th of a second counted then ok.  Also, more importantly, as AbuAmerican said-it could void your warranty- check with Toyota first.
RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... it will make a difference if you will change your header, and  full exhaust system. it's a landcruiser, why set it up? plus you might get rip off, k&n filters goes for around Qr250.I'm not into 4wd. if you want to set up a car, go for honda or 350Z!!!
RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... Agree with all the above - it's a bus for #$%& sake. The difference is negligable. Besides, with the dust in Qatar you are better off with the factory fitted filter which is designed for our conditions
RE: Is it a good idea to put a KN Filter on my new... Bro, I agree with cdpascual initial performance gainer would be Intake/Header/Exhaust modifications. If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better, with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty.  Cheers,

Valid Work Permit, entry 6 months passport? Hi,  I have a valid work permit not expiring until next year. My question is will a passport with less than 6 months be a problem when entering the country again? has anyone got an idea or experienced something similar to this situation?  Thanks
you can't enter in any you can't enter in any country if you have expired passport even though you have valid permit, even your own country will not allow or give you exit,.
First- when you leaving your First- when you leaving your country they might refuse to let you go- so better renew you passport there and keep the old one with rp when you enter Doha.upon coming back - transfer the rp at immigration- 100 qr
My point is that Thanks all. My point is that my passport expires in September. I need to travel in March, which leaves exactly 6 months validity on my passport. I don't think it will be a problem entering the country I entend to visit but I was wondering if it will cause a problem when I return to doha with less than 6 months on the passport (even though i have a valid work visa). If I renew now, I won't be able to travel in March as the renewal process takes about a month. I wish I could postpone but I can't.
You can ask your embassy if You can ask your embassy if they can give you temporary extension? In our embassy, we have an option to extend.
Yes, it can. Unfortunately Yes, it can. Unfortunately you can't predict who will be the immigration official on duty when you come back to Doha. Could you slide? Possibly. Could you be refused. Also possible, sorry! Mandi
Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? how good (or bad) are their services compared to let's say Aramex? can anyone please enlighten as i am going to enroll in any one of them? thank you very much!
RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? Try FEDEX, they are the best!!
RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? I've heard DHL are quicker but Aramex are cheaper.
RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? The service is OK. i am using it since it launched.. but the charges are high.. even though the shipment is less than a kilo then charge for 1.5 to 1.6 KG citing volumetric reasons.. this is bit unreasonable. i havent tried Aramex, but seems to be better than DHL. DHL is faster no doubt but be prepared to pay the price.... of not less than 130 QAR for any weight....
RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? DHL has faster transit time from US to Qatar. Rates from US to Qatar - first 0.5kg is QR 59 and each additional 0.5kg is QR 30. DHL Flexiship might be  good option for regular internet shoppers.
RE: Has anyone had any experiences with DHL Easy Shop? Enjoy discounted rates using DHL EasyShop service.Import heavy weight goods through your P O Box address in USA and receive discounts upto 50%
Qatar International School Can anyone tell me what's happening at QIS? Have heard rumours that the old owners of the school have been asked to leave Doha.  Who is running it now? Will there be problems for the students now?
Although there will be a new Although there will be a new principal everything at the school is staying the same in fact there are very nice improvements happening it is as if the school is having a facelift. There is really nothing to worry about
There aren't going to be any changes The Principal and Vice Principal are leaving but no one else. The principal had little involvement in the day to day running of the school anyway. There shouldn't be any changes to the school.
Qatar International School is Qatar International School is very good. It's been around for a very long time.   Exam results are good and the children are well behaved and happy.   The only problem- that you might have trouble getting your children into the school as it has long waiting lists.
QIS or ASD Dear QIS Parents,  I have my daughter (5 year old) who is attending ASD now for 2nd year (in KG grade). ASD is a good school, esp. in its management, administration, facilities etc. However I am concerned about the extreme liberal environment of the school and wonder if QIS is a better choice? How is academics of QIS and what about the issue that is of my concern.  Thanks for your feedback,  Regards,
i go to QIS too!  yeah i i go to QIS too!  yeah i heard about this a few months ago, nothing has changed so im guessing its just a rumour.

RE: where I can find a tattooist? Be satisfied with what God has given you. Donot change creation of God. God donot like it.

about lcd tv? hi... what is much better hard panel lcd tv or soft panel lcd tv. tnx a lot........
RE: about lcd tv? I presume you mean plasma TV versus LCD tv?  If so, I would choose LCD tv definitely. I've had both, and I can confirm that whilst LCD might be a bit more expensive than plasma, it is definitely worth the difference, because you get clearer crisper video quality
RE: about lcd tv? Go for a LCD , although expensive but you pay for the quality. Plasma have a limited life span afterwhich its quality viewing deteriorates as it ages.  Cheers,

RE: Mahindra scorpio DOHA MOTORS
RE: Mahindra scorpio please dont waste your money .. move along with advancement and technology ,,
RE: Mahindra scorpio You can get Mahindra Scorpio form Doha motors and trading company. This company is at Al Matar street just adjacent to Air port and before parachute roundabout. I know in India, it is very good and famous vehicle. I too like it. But here in Doha, I have seen only 3 to 4 scorpio vehicles. I know that it is a good vehicle but also please think about resale value. Here maximum people are not aware of mahindra and TATA vehicles. TATA Heavy vehicles only I have seen. Therefore you can not expect more money while selling the vehicle.  Best regards, Ramakrishna Nalabothula

Can you help.... Can you help me find a good dentist who can do braces for a 10yr old child in Doha ?  How much would be the total expenditure ?  Or is it advisable to do it from your home country ? If so, what do you do when it comes to follow up consultations ?   Please advise..and thanx in advance...
RE: Can you help.... well...I was told that "the earlier the better"....
RE: Can you help.... Dental Services is quite expensive in GCC, its better to get it done in your home country. If money is not a matter, then you will find lots of them in and around Doha.
RE: Can you help.... If your child's front teeths came out and you want to fix braces to become the teeths in level, I think no dentist will prefer to fix it. Because your child is growing now and the shape of the face is not yet completed.So it is not good to fix braces in this gowing time.  It is very cosly here to fix braces. If your company provided insurance and the insurance company will cover this type of treatment then Okay. If you doing it in India, you have consult the dentist 2 to 3 times to tight the braces.  Anyway contact a good physician and ask advise.  Best regards

in this place, there are lots of surprising normal occurrence - it is normal to let children play inside a moving vehicle sans seat belts; few others leave them for "MOMENTS" (meaning - HOURS in this part of the world)locked, under the bright sunlight of about about 50+ degrees. - it is normal to turn left or right without lights indicator on; or using the right signal to turn left and things like that.  It is even normal to tailgate, use mobile phones at a NORMAL 100 KPH when the NORMAL posted LIMIT is 80.  Thus NORMALLY everyone seems to accept that it is NORMAL to ADD + 20 or more to the posted LIMIT; or drive half the speed limit when about 20 vehicles tailing with no one else in front . - It is normal to talk about issues of neighboring countries while being blind on issues just in front of us.  - it is NORMAL to tell everyone to choose to leave if you don't like the rules, though, you cannot leave as you have chosen when you tender your resignation. -  i wish i can rant some more , but i've normally, accepted these realities, as most people do.
Car AC Dears,  Recenlty, I used my car's AC heater, after some time my child said me to switch off the heater, because she felt too hot. Even though I switched off (the knob is in hot position) the AC  I saw hot air is coming from the window of the AC. When the car stop the hot air also stop. When the car take speed, the air also come out too hot.   Is there any problem in my car AC, it is 2009 model car ? Any one can give an advise ?
RE: Car AC It might just be the residual hot air coming through. Try turning the temperature setting to halfway between hot and cold.
RE: Car AC check your AC ventilation. the air ventilation should be coming from inside the car and not air coming from outside the car. send me PM so that i can explain to you what i am saying.
RE: Car AC Check the knob of the thermostat control. Try to set the pointer of the knob at the lowest cold position. Normally the furthest set point is when you turn the knob  at counterclockwise direction.
RE: Car AC <code><b>There would be another knob with "Recirc" & "Fresh" options.....select the "Recirc" option....here you go....the problem is solved :-)  PS: No need to change the thermostat or anything else.</code></b>

RE: Looking for a Chiropractor The doctor at doha Chiropractic Center is a highly qualified american female.. who treats both female and male..
RE: Looking for a Chiropractor Hi, yes to answer your question... he has a one year old himself and has 12 years experience in Canada.  He specialized in sports before and treated members of the National Hockey Team and National Basketball Team.  He was very good when we met with him and listened to everything we had to say, rather than rushing us in an out of the office. The person there before us had had chronic migraines and he was able to treat her the once and she had no more problems.  Anyway, his name is Dr. McCrimmon.  Definitely reccommend you give him a shout!
RE: Looking for a Chiropractor Dr.Sharon treats both children and adults.. i've heard that lots of families take their children there for check-ups..and that its pretty good..

RE: Looking for a Chiropractor Yes, there is (finally) a very good Canadian chiropractor practicing here in Qatar who I would highly recommend.  It's really hard to find someone qualified and properly trained but he is very good, my whole family can definitely vouch for him.  Cell number is: 648-2036

Can my kid get school admission in September in CBSE School Hi I am moving to Qatar in August and I want my daughter's admission in KG1 in a good CBSE school. Which are the good CBSE schools in Qatar (fees is not an issue) and what are the chances of securing admission in Aug / sept.  She is currently studying in a CBSE school in Dubai.
RE: Can my kid get school admission in September in CBSE... you can get admission here through out the year and kg 1 would be no big problem. The other classes have to take a test but about the kg level i am not sure.
RE: Can my kid get school admission in September in CBSE... Best Indian school is   DPS-MIS (Modern Indian School) http://www.dpsmisdoha.com  You can get admission for next term which will be starting in October...  All the Indian schools here follow CBSE Syllabus  Birla Public School Doha Modern Indian School (Not recommended)  MES Indian School Ideal Indian School
RE: Can my kid get school admission in September in CBSE... FS i totally agree with you.I too give importance to other skills a child develops in school+academics(mark sheet).But i dont think there is any thing great about DPS or BPS.Being a full time mom(housewife),i have plenty of time to compare notes of all three school.I find it almost the same.Almost all schools are same level . Ofcourse the quality of the schools reflects in their behavior.To me home is the best school & parents are the best teacher here in Qatar.
RE: Can my kid get school admission in September in CBSE... Saj, U said it right.
why supermarkets not keeping coins? why supermarkets not keeping coins?always they are giving chewing gum  or chocolate.is it dificult to keep coins in qatar? or this is a business trick? if we argue they will ask coin from us. anyway.... this is not a good habit.
Discussed before, here Discussed before, here :- http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1462414  http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1714475
You can refuse chewing gums You can refuse chewing gums or chocolates. They are asked by the Ministry to keep sufficient coins with them.
Why dont u buy a box of chewing gum Buy a box of Chewing gum and keep it in ur car carry a packet with u in person,every time a cashiers tries to push you with chewing gum for the loose change,1st refuse,but if they insist then give them ur packet and ask for 1 buck .....they will not take it an will arrange to return the coins.  I tried it many times it works well
what if what if the same happened at the time of buy the first new box of Chewing gum !!
The trouble is that they The trouble is that they aren't allowed to give gum as change.   So a lot of major supermarkets will pick up a piece of gum or chocolate and scan it, so that it adds to the bill and rounds it up to an even number.    Therefore the gum isn't change, but another item of your shopping.  I always just pay with a card these days, that way you only pay for what you want, and not a dirham more.

Metals used for coin making Metals used for coin making are expensive now due to voracious demand from china and elsewhere for other useful items derived from the same metal.  I even heard a humor that coins are being hoarded and melted to be used for making other more valuable metal products.

Bringing Prescription Medicine To Qatar Dear friends,  Please tell me if I will face a problem if I am carrying my own personal prescription medicines with me to Qatar. I have the prescription of my Indian Doctor.  I would have to carry about 365 of those capsules for 1 year of stay in Doha.  I think they open and check all the bags at airport.  What about sending them by courier to Qatar with prescription? Is it allowed?  Thank you, Junaid
They are not opening each and They are not opening each and evey bag at the Airport. They will open only those bags which is suspicious of having something illegal. You can bring your medicines with the proof of purchase and the prescription from your doctor. There are many patients bringing their medicine for diabetes and blood pressure in hundreds.
As far as our experience As far as our experience goes, there is no problem as long as you have your prescription.  We have been here 4 1/2 yrs and have never been stopped and questioned at the airport.  You can send it by courier with the prescription but it goes to "Customs" for clearance. I don't see any problem with you carrying these meds.  Best regards  Dez
If you send it by courier, If you send it by courier, they may open and check and then put a 'customs checked' seal / tape on the package, since it's medicines.   If you bring it with you, they may check, depends on the type of medication, but if u have a prescription with you, it shouldn't be a problem.   Like others have stated here, many bring painkillers, diabetes, n hypertension drugs with them here.
Junaid If u bring it along with you, there wont be any problem, keep prescription and bill with you. But if u send it by courier then after customs checking it will go to HMC (White fort building) , then you have to go there with prescription and receipt and need to convince the Doctor in charge to collect the medicines. ( Last yr i collected some indian ayurvedic medicines same way which was couriered)
They don't open all bags at They don't open all bags at airport. Only if they find something suspicious they will open it. Medicines with doctor's prescription is not a problem. and as sanooj said if u send it by courier the medicines will be sent to HMC and then returned back after verification.
I'm sorry I meant to say his I'm sorry I meant to say his Highness the bloody murderer and dictator Sadam huseen
advice.. do not put it on your hand carry bag.. (bring some with you in case you need to drink while on the aircraft) but the rest leave it on your check in luggage..
Thank you all very much for Thank you all very much for the advice...

Driving to UAE Gas credit cards or cash Hi, We traveling to Abu Dhabi tomorrow, My question is if you can pay at the gas stations and the insurance on the border(s) in KSA and UAE with ATM, Credit card or only Cash QAR or only local currency? Can you exchange QAR on the borders? Thank you Regards
RE: Driving to UAE Gas credit cards or cash Cash only, and most places on the way accept QAR, no need to exchange anything.  When you get to your destination, get some cash through an atm using your atm card.
RE: Driving to UAE Gas credit cards or cash for gas stations in dubai, you need cash. in AD you should be ok w/ CC. re all else, cant help.
RE: Driving to UAE Gas credit cards or cash So far you have yes and no! Great answers eh! As i found out ,,, Petrol - cash only except at large ADNOC service stations - the ones with good CLEAN toilets!  Insurance CASH only. The take most currencies and the exchange rate is quite fair!
RE: Driving to UAE Gas credit cards or cash Insurance is only by cash or you can buy insurance here in Doha through Al Khaleej Insurance Company Bank Street. Only ADNOC fuel stations in Abu Dhabi accept credit cards, you may not have to refuel your car if you have double fuel tanks. My Nissan Petrol dose 650km with two tanks and I had to refuel at Dubai - Abu Dhabi border only. Petrol in Abu Dhabi is QR4.25\Gallon in Dubai QR6.25\Gallon.

RE: Hi, I'm flying in on the 3rd Jan to start a new job,...

RE: Hi, I'm flying in on the 3rd Jan to start a new job,... Welcome to Doha! Well anyways aside from the usual stuff that you have to bring, clothes, toiletress, etc. don't forget to bring your passport, visa and everything.

It maybe up to 6 degree celsius.. but im not sure i am not from the weather center.. hehehe well anyways, goodluck and welcome to doha!
RE: Hi, I'm flying in on the 3rd Jan to start a new job,... Ya know what, I really didn't need a thing, my furnished villa was so well done. The only things I can't find here at a reasonable price are LOTS of book so I brought those. Music CDs the same.

QR26,000 per month is the QR26,000 per month is the salary.  Housing of QR26,000 per month is a receipted expense, I.E. if the villa costs QR26K they pay QR26K, if it costs QR10K they pay QR10K therefore it's not worth taking anywhere cheaper.  Will 2.5K per month be enough to lease a decent car?
Sandeep and Hannah: take a Sandeep and Hannah: take a room! :)
If housing is a receipted If housing is a receipted expense then QR26K for Country Manager sounds quite low ...though I think would be sufficient to support ur family of five depending offcourse again on your lifestyle and if ur looking for a decent enough savings... ________________________________________ One life to live, live it to the fullest.

Business Visa Invitation Letter My sister's visa came out under business visa.Could anybody give me an idea or layout as well in making a business invitation letter from the sponsor coz the sponsor doesnt have idea?All idea will be highly appreciated.Thanks and have a nice day to all!
hi sir!what i need are the hi sir!what i need are the  contents/details in a business visa invitation letter from the sponsor.
The company should give an The company should give an invitation letter to your sister i don't know the exact drafts and contents of letter but it is needed for completion of all documents for stamp of visa in qatar embassy and also in the airport in the immigration and one more advise nowadays the immigration officer in our country is more stricter for those having tourist and business visa to minimize human trafficking advise her to be smart for answering all the question of the immigration officer. goodluck
To Elpresidente Yes one of my friend has been hold to the immigration because of the changing moods of the immigration officer actually Ive experience it also last 2007 they are asking me whats the purpose of my stay and what kind of business im doing here in doha because its my first time im little bit nervous and the immigration officer refuse to stamp my passport that's why i change lanes and the other good officer there let me pass i think its depends upon there moods but nowadays its more stricter they asking for valid ID that your working there in the Philippines and the real purpose of your stay here in qatar is business and not for job purposes.
contents? as far as i know these should be the details:  1. duration (i.e. how many months, starting from when until what date) 2. Full name (written in passport) 3. Passport information (passport no., place of issue, date of expiry, nationality)  Note: it should be addressed to "The Consulate General, State of Qatar" should be printed in company letterhead, signature of authorized signatory and company stamp
Discounts on 3 year Visa Renewal charges . I have been charged QR.2800 on a 3 year R/P renewal whilst the tariff says a 20% discount is available for 3 year renewals!  Any one knows what is the calculation for 3 year discounted R/P charges ?  (No explanation received from counter staff)
Obviously you get 20% on the Obviously you get 20% on the third year only. Instead of 1.000 you pay only 800.

A Lot of Thanks to 'ABAYA' They are free to wear any thing under the 'ABAYA' it's their very personal issue, But in abayas they look  respectable... at least they respect the society..
Anything they bloomin well like I expect and good for them.  I love the Abaya, it covers a multitude of sins for me. I loved having to wear one in Saudi. Meant that I could wear anything underneath that was comfortable.  Great idea.   My thoughts are my own, but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.
Has The Mystery SOLVED Has The Mystery SOLVED ??  Did anyone found out wats under the ABAYA ?  Is it the round round spongy body or something else ??  <a title="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"><img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" /></a>
well eco... if you go through life thinking everyone has an ulterior motive behind every question then you are going to live a really sad and pathetic life. why not give people the benefit of the doubt and open your eyes to a more positive way of thinking? Makes life much more enjoyable.   If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-

I've been here nearly 3 I've been here nearly 3 years and have no idea what they wear. I catch the odd glimpse of some high heels and the hem of a pair of jeans, but that's it. Why does everyone assume we should know what they wear? It's not like we can go up and ask them, or stare long enough to find out, is it?
ahh rizks... now we know..you've been fantasizing about what's under there...see, tallg hasn't so he still wonders what's under there...now you know TG...  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-

michoo123, is that a michoo123, is that a question or a statement?
tats the main michoo.....  tats the main issue here which bothers most of us ...:)  So sit back and feel the imaginations of many people around for this question ....:) <a title="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"><img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" /></a>
It depends upon the mood of It depends upon the mood of the person. I think it would be more appropriate to know from where this abaya came or its origin so that one can come to conclusion. Abaya, the black thobe, is not an Islamic order or must. The only cover Islam requires women to have is to wear something which covers the whole body from head to toe & the only thing should be visible is face, hands & feet. Second thing is the dress should not be revealing or body fitting, it should be something decent which should not give a hint about their figure nor it should be too loose which might attract others attention to make u a fun object. Third thing that should be taken care about is the dress should have modest colours & not shining & lots of art work which would attract opposite gender.   Now coming to abaya, no where in Islam it is mentioned, neither is Quran nor in Ahadees (Sayings of Holy Prophet PBUH). Abaya is something cultural, sometimes ladies are made to wear these so that they are not identified by hiding their faces too with Nakaabs (face veils). Majority of men make their women use face veils because they are in a culture where people make fun of families for not following cultural values, sometiems out of enimity if a woman of a certain family is identifiable they kidnap her or try to harass her only to degrade any particular family. Sometimes, it is simply the choice of woman who feels comfortable in wearing abaya only because if she comes out in normal islamic dress, she'll have several stares from other women, forget about men at this stage. So instead of answering everyone why she is not following cultural values / dresses she prefers to make their mouth shut by being one of them. Sometimes its too humid outside & if the lady wants to follow her islamic dressing too she might wear something short inside & on it she can wear a loose abaya, thus giving her comfort + no sense of guilt. So there  are several possibilities that come with abaya thing.   My own thinking is that abaya is a full dress, its something like a man wearing shalwar kameez, or a woman wearing skirt shirt or an arabic man wearing white thobe so there is no need to wear additional dress to it. Briefs or vests are okay to make urself comfortable but wearing a skirt shirt then wearing a abaya for a corniche walk that goes beyond my mind. But yes, if you are working in a woman only environment & as humans like to show off what new dress or shoes do they have, they remove their abayas in there & move along with whatever decent they are wearing.   Looks like I have written something boring so better to finish it off here :)  Cheers :)   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++        CONFUSE ............ if you cannot convince! <a href="http://www.glitterfy.com/"><img src="http://img34.glitterfy.com/342/glitterfy063341T565F.gif" alt="Glitter Words" border=0 /></a><br /><

well if everyone would just take a question without getting their nose out of joint and answer appropiately, there is no problem...  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
actually, I think ummjake answered it best when she said it was like women wondering what's under a kilt. Human nature..curiosity.  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
risk that is real funny! LOL Lol , Did you like what you was watching under the Abaya? Did it smell good? Come on man, tell us the real essence of that lady?

FS... if he is new to the Middle East...then yes, I do think he has no clue..its so foreign to western culture that it sparks curiosity. Even I didn't know what women wore under them until I went to a wedding and the ladies took the abayas off.  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
When I first got to Qatar I had no idea what women wore under their abayas.  Then as I got to meet more local women, I figured out it was just normal everyday clothes.  Imagine my surprise when I attended my first Qatari wedding and saw all the abayas falling off to reveal these va-va-va-VOOM dresses that shocked even me, and would have made the flashbulbs go off on any red carpet in Hollywood.  My jaw was on the floor -- couldn't have imagined they would be wearing THOSE kinds of dresses on underneath. So appearances can often be deceiving...  ;-)
Scarlett sure he is very innocent when his interest are food, gardening and women

I know ummjake... It is like a fashion show at the weddings..each dress and lady looking more gorgeous than the next! I have to admit to ordering an abaya made for me a few months ago so I'd have one to wear if I needed it for any formal function...and ended up wearing it to the Islamic museum opening...they are extremely comfortable!!

Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV We are decided to buy one 40" LCD TV. Can anyone suggest which company and which series having all USB port, connection with computer, DVD, handy cam......?. Our budget is 4 - 4.5K. Kindly Suggest.
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV i have a samsung, it's been almost 3 years.. didn't get any problem at all. no problem in connecting to TV, DVD, Blue-Ray and computers.  sony one start developing a blue blob( spot) on the screen that after some time eat up the entire screen and the entire screen become blue. thats common problem with sony.  i guess LG and Samsung having the same features.
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV Dear fireheartin,  2 days back we bought Samsung 5 series 40" TV from lulu. Not yet connected with dish. so we use USB, Hard disk to see the movie. it is not showing the movie/video  option. Only showing the photos and music icon. so we are going 2 change the TV having all option like photos, video, and music. that's why i  raised the question.
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV All the LCDs are almost same.. You can pick Sony or samsung
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV Go for LED TV..
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV Dear Selvi...  Samsung LCDS don't play the movies from USB port. Only the LED Tv that too series 7 and 8 only have the usb movie option.Recently we bought a SAMSUNG LED TV series 7 from lulu centre. It came around 8750 riyal in digital delights offer and we got a 32 inch LCD TV at free of cost... So i think if want usb movie option then u have to purchase a LED tv. Not a LCD....
RE: Kindly give suggestion for purchasing  a TV Nothing better than Samsung in LCD & LED market. Check the model suitable for you before finalize. My own experience and many experts in this field suggest only Samsung. Trust me.
Any Richard Dawkins fans? Ahoy there fellow primates V 3.0 Any Richard Dawkins fan around?
Not really ,he is not full of Not really ,he is not full of himself , imagine yourself in his shoes? dozens and dozens of people try to debate logic and scientific facts based on thousands of years old scriptures. It must be tough. Especially his hate e-mail. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZuowNcuGsc&feature=related
RD Surprised to see this posted. I've read his books for 20 years and the Science is fascinating. Nevertheless, I'm not  sure that atheism can be explicitly expressed openly here.
Yeah, but I guess here is Yeah, but I guess here is acceptable at some extent. Anyhow , his books are made simple for the simple common minds, a genius he is ,I must confess! Do you have any of his books please?! Cheers.
Why is not atheism acceptable Why is not atheism acceptable here? It's a point of view, the same as believing in god or believing in fast cars or the bottom of a whisks bottle. If you are scared of atheism then your faith must be weak
I have strong disagreements I have strong disagreements with what he says but I agree with his main point...also I don't particularly mind his aggressive approach
yes, sure atheism is not yes, sure atheism is not acceptable here like Satanism...
but isn't satan the ultimate but isn't satan the ultimate rebel and the original freedom fighter braveheart
Dawkins believes satan Dawkins believes satan doesn't exist so that is good for all of us
Men believed the universe Men believed the universe revolved around the earth until we knew better, same with the universe. Just because we don't know everything doesn't mean you can make something up to fill the gaps! That's what children do!
I am wise enough and I am wise enough and comfortable enough to say I don't know. I don't need to fill the void with fantasies, such as sun gods, moon goods, animal gods, gods in the image of man etc.
great,.. if you don't know, great,.. if you don't know, this doesn't men there's no god. because if you are wise enough, you should believe there's someone created all of this....  next step,. you have to know,.. because this answer will not relief you in the judgement day... this is an faithful advise...
I don't know if you are a I don't know if you are a child abuser either but that doesn't make you a child abuser does it.  If your faith in one god, ignoring the other 6900 since the Sumerians, makes you happy then good for you. I'm not hear to change your faith or beliefs, you are free to believe in whatever you want no matter how ridiculous
Never heard of him.......who Never heard of him.......who is he? and no I can't be bothered to google him.....
He wrote the Selfish Gene one He wrote the Selfish Gene one of the seminal books on evolution in the 1970s as well as many others. I recommend the Blind Watchmaker as a superbly written science book. Recently he has drifted into the God arena and wrote the God Deluision a few years ago. Another interesting read

Believing in God and Angels? Believing in God and Angels? Damn! that is too mainstream! I believe in the flying spaghetti monster, and JoJo of the sea!
so if God is not there, then so if God is not there, then Satan is not there,..so why people are making sins,...?? answer that is you can,.. :P
If Heaven Kitty and Satanic If Heaven Kitty and Satanic Kitten do not exist, then why cats keep publicly have intercourse? Answer? because they can!
What are sins? What you What are sins? What you consider a sin, is not what someone else would think it is a sin. Sin is a human made concept for control
QDC, in your company, going QDC, in your company, going home before the end of shift is a sin. it's a rule put by the owners, known by all staff, and violators are being punished (and that's why we adhere to rules). then you can have an organized company of say 100 people.  so why you cannot imagine the whole universe have an owner who put rules, and have a judgement day,.. ??!!  simple isn't it
One day I might if there is One day I might if there is evidence. So far no evidence of a designer or ruler of the universe
I am not picking anything I am not picking anything up.  Did you or did you not say: "but the last thing I want is to be e-Bashed by non-factual thousands of years old poetry"?  You didn't say it's written in a poetic style, you said the words "non-factual" and "poetry".  Yes I (and many others) get offended when you accuse the Holy scriptures of being poetry.
Okay let me clear this up, Okay let me clear this up, since I am pretty sure you picked up your English through Hollywood movies. Fact: is something /event .... that has happened/could be proven logically and PHYSICALLY. Poetry: Poetry is a style of written/spoken literature. Please clear up why you got offended. As a Muslim and MATURE individual , I do not get easily offended, just because I did not fully understand the other person doesn't mean I have to be offended...
You are entitled to your own You are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts. Religion has no basis In facts
QDCLover You just summed up everything I wanted to say! Cheers mate.
It's fine if you want to It's fine if you want to disagree with me that is your right but you can say what I write is baseless, you have no evidence for that!

Qatar Career Fair 2010 Is it allowed for a non-Qatari recent graduate to submit his/her resume there?...I will appreciate your advice.   Thanks.
RE: Qatar Career Fair 2010 Its only for Qataris...you still can submit your CV..but dont think they would consider it...
RE: Qatar Career Fair 2010 As far as i have heard,this career fair has been established to provide employment opportunities to qatari nationals,BUT, since you are a Doha resident,i would advise you to attend the career fair because you will have nothing to lose,and besides the vast number of companies and corporations that are taking part in the fair is sure to interest any job-seeker,whether Qatari or non-Qatari,so go for it,and INSHA ALLAH all the best!

Is this good price? I went to Mitsubishi Showroom Salwa and asked the price for Lancer 2009 model 1.6L...The last price they can give around 54k with full option but w/o sun roof. Is this good price?
RE: Is this good price? If you can pay more,you can get a corolla,so you save your money when you want to sell it!!!
RE: Is this good price? Yeah it is a good price, less than a Corolla of course. Corolla is a common ride for many people these days. It is better to go with Lancer GT...powerful, reliable and comfort. GT comes with sun roof by da way.   Good Luck
RE: Is this good price? Whats the big deal about a sunroof anyhow? You can only use 4 months out of the year and partially if that.
RE: Is this good price? No Resale value for this Mistubishi Car..  Best & the great choice TOYOTA OR HONDA.

Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives) damage the car paint? Hi all,  I am planning for a road trip to dubai from doha next week. I saw in some posts that If I use the sand like spray, i have to polish the car to remove it. Some said using dish washing liquid is the cheap and best option. Does the dish washing liquid damage the car paint? My car color is black, so I am a bit concerned.
RE: Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives)... I have used the sand like spray,... it does not need polish to be removed. It comes off just by water. And car paint is not effected. Not sure how safe the washing liquid is on the car paint. I think people use it because its cheaper than the sand spray.
RE: Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives)... thanks shakstar
RE: Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives)... Use Clear Shield paint protection from Titanium,it protects you from all sand scratches and also paint fading. visit www.solargard.com.  If you need more info send me a PM, i will get you very good price also
RE: Does applying dish washing liquid (for long drives)... It is better and safer to use the sand like spray to protect the paint of your car from the abrassive sand storm that you may encounter on your road trip to Dubai. It is specifically designed for that purpose.

Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT VISA ? I was working in a Qatari Company for 2 years I had to go to my Country and for some reasons my Resident VISA Got expired.  I have come again on the same Company on VISIT VISA and for last 06 months, I am working.  My salary has been transferred to same OLD Bank Account. Can I apply for SCHENGEN VISA and How ?
RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... You are only a visitor and not a resident. Check with French Embassy.
RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... nope you cannot..you should be a resident here and stayed at least 6 months on your current RP..check with Italian embassy which is easier for Schengen visa as per my experience.
RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... If you are on a VISIT VISA you CANNOT apply for any foreign Visa from here. YOU HAVE to have an RP as your sponsor will have to vouch for you.
RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... you can Apply for a Visa, Even if you are on Visit Visa, Just get a NOC letter from your Company...   Saudi Visas's are issued even if a Person is on a Visit Visa, provided he Submits a NOC.   Even Other GCC Countries, Except US, and UK.....   One of my Friends wife even got a 1 year Multiple Visa for Malaysia on Family Visit Visa, In a Day.... :)
RE: Apply SCHENGEN VISA from Qatar while on Qatar VISIT... Italian Embassy is the worst at handing out Schengen visas. It took me 3 months with lots of hassle to get mine.  I hear the French Embassy is way easier, will be going through them next time.
Without Exit Visa!!! Hello everybody...  Good Day!  I just want to ask if it is possible to work there in QATAR without cancelling my work visa here in Bahrain, because my employer refused to cancel my working visa here in bahrain. Is there any other option? pls. help me guys.. May God Bless you all..Thank you so much
RE: Without Exit Visa!!! I don't know if anything can be done from here since the cancellation of your visa must be done at the Bahrain airport, not here in Doha.   If your visa is expiring anytime soon, say within the next two to three months, I'm not sure either if your residence permit in Doha would be processed if your Bahrain visa has not been cancelled but has expired.  Let's wait for some additional info from other QLers.
RE: Without Exit Visa!!! Welcome to Qatar with a new passport if your employer is not cancelling the Visa due to some reasons.
RE: Without Exit Visa!!! As the guy above said, get a new passport, no problems then!!
Does Anyone Homeschool? I have been homeschooling my daughter for over 3 years since the start of her education and have no desire to send her to a public institution regardless of how highly rated it might be.  Does anyone know firsthand if there are any regulations regarding this?  We will be moving to Doha after Ramadan, I have asked my husband about this but he can't seem to find the answers.
Read This: Qatar authorities Read This: <b>Qatar authorities enforce strict education rules</b>  http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/qatar/qatar-authorities-enforce-strict-education-rules-1.776451
I think that this applies to I think that this applies to Qataris only.

Gerber baby cereal Hi Does anybody knows where can i get Gerber Cereals here in doha. I was getting it in Shoprite only.but now its out of stock there. So where else is it available???? Thanks
RE: Gerber baby cereal I used to see it at Carrefour... but no more lately... I'm buying now HIPP organic from Lulu ... double the price but I won't go for Farleys and Hero as I don't trust these brands

RE: Gerber baby cereal shoprite hardly ever stocks it...and incase u didnt notice..usually they have it when its close 2 expiry!!my 2 kids have grown up having farleys..its pretty good...u cud give it a shot..its as good as gerber..for some reason they have stopped stocking gerber here in qatar..and fyi megamart is in "the Centre" mall

Al-Gharrafa  area, whats it like? Hi, I am moving to Qatar in the next couple of weeks and we will be living in Al-Gharrafa. What's this area like? I also have a 6 year old boy so any schools near this area? Thanks in anticipation
re:Moving to Al Gharrafa Welcome to Qatar Gharrafa is a nice quite area and is ideal for families. There is a good shopping centre named Lulu in the area. They are a few schools like Qatar Canadian school and  Compass International School but trust me it is hard to get into. Most schools have a waiting list. This by far will be your biggest challenge. Keep me posted and I will try to help you out. Good luck!!
Al Gharafa is fine - for the Al Gharafa is fine - for the most part no section of Doha is that much better or worse than any other.  Unlike some other cities in the world, the expats are not concentrated in particular areas - so anywhere you land will be fine.  As for schools, Compass is right there in Al Gharafa and is the school that my 5yo son attends.  Sherbourne isn't too bad of a run from Al Gharafa (I don't think it is, anyway).  Like ominstructor said, getting into a school is going to be your biggest challenge.  Good luck!
Thanks Thanks for the info thats very useful. I know finding a school for my son will be very challenging. compass is a very expensive school!!!  Any ideas about the Gulf English School, there website is not updated since last year and tried to email them but the email bounced back. also tried to phone from the UK and was on hold for a long time and had to give up at the end. Thanks
I have a friend whose kids I have a friend whose kids are at the Gulf English School.  I'm sure she'd be willing to give you her feedback - PM me or send me an email (I think I sent it to you) if you want to touch base with her.
Thanks that would be great, whats your email?
entrance exams for schools Hi My daughter is due to sit entrance exams for a start in Sept 2010 in year 7 (11+) stage.  Anyone got any tips or insider info on what she needs to study to help her?  Any advice gratefully received!
Entrance exams You really do need to say which school or schools she will be trying to get into. For some schools, the most important requirements are a British passport and loads and loads of cash to pay the extortionate school fees.
This seems to be the strange This seems to be the strange thing.  How important is the entrance test? Or is it as you say a British passport and cash gets them in.  We have visited the schools that follow the british and international curriculum - on the whole most have been very helpful and friendly - but one in particular (the name of our city is in its name) was particularly unhelpful and cold towards us.  Some schools have said a formal test on Math, English and some science - others have said multiple choice - I don't know if my daughter is at the right stage or if she needs to do some extra work - and if so what work - if anyone has any information on the exams - I would very much appreciate some guidance - it is beginning to worry me - or am I worrying unecessarily and just the passport and money will get her a place!?
They're trying to weed out They're trying to weed out those students with Special Educational Needs and they're also checking on their standard of English (which shouldn't be a problem for a native speaker).
Worrying about a School Place My old sparring partner Squarepeg is quite right, of course. A lot of schools in Doha have little or no provision for SEN children and there is not much in the way of EAL support either. Trying to get the students through a curriculum that is in their second language is no easy task, so of course many schools would prefer to have more students for whom English is their "mother tongue".   If a school has a significant proportion of Qatari students, then of course the Supreme and Absolutely Perfect Education Council of Qatar will want to make sure that the little darlings are getting lots and lots of lessons in Arabic and Islamic Studies. (That's a fat lot of use if your family are not Muslims and and you speak English as your first language.) Learning Arabic may sound like a fun thing for your child to do, but it isn't because the Arabic teachers follow the Supreme and Immaculate Education Council's orders and therefore they teach it in a really dull and useless way, instead of concentrating on conversational Arabic that could be useful and enjoyable. As for Islamic Studies, the teachers (who are usually Egyptians or Lebanese) do not want to lose their jobs and so they let the students see the exam papers before the actual exams, so that they can memorise all of the answers. Then the students get amazingly high marks and everyone is happy.
Which school does your Which school does your daughter currently attend.  The teachers may be able to help you.
To keep the forum on To keep the forum on track... you are from the UK so I wouldnt worry in the least about the entrance exams. These exams are general knowledge tests which determine what level she is at and her english abilities.   As for Islamic and arabic studies, they arent mandatory at a lot of international school (only in some instances are arabic lessons mandatory but certainly not Quran).  ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
"Aren't mandatory" Amoud has kindly suggested that Islamic Studies and Arabic are not mandatory at some schools in Qatar. He (or she) may well be right. The bad news, however, is that long waiting lists and lack of places ARE mandatory, it would appear, at all of the better schools in Doha. (These are usually the ones that do not have lots of Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum.) Yes, a British passport does indeed come in handy, but so does a very big pile of cash. The better schools know that they are oversubscribed and so (surprise, surprise) they put up their fees accordingly.    I have no problem at all with the idea of expat children learning Arabic. I do, however, get very annoyed with the way that the Completely Wonderful Education Council insists that expat children should be taught Arabic in a way that is totally boring, lifeless and insipid. When I was teaching in Doha, several expat parents told me that they were happy for their children to learn Arabic, but they wanted them to learn conversational Arabic that the children could actually use. When I quizzed the teachers, they said that the Utterly Amazing Education Council laid down the law about how Arabic should be taught, so it is just another example of the Totally Magnificent Education Council screwing things up.  Great to hear from you again, Squarepeg. I am now teaching at a school in the UAE, but I thought that it might be fun to have a look at Qatar Living, for old times' sake.
Hippo, what you are telling Hippo, what you are telling her has absolutely nothing to do with what she is asking, and to be honest a british passport does nothing for her if she is applying to a non-British school and then may not have much weight if the school does not have a policy of allowing entrance to it nationals first.   Also, the huge pile of cash is baloney as well. If you have the money to pay the fees, or the company pays thats sufficient.   The exams are also for the 2010 start, which she will have sufficient time for climbing the waiting list. It isn't as cynical as you make it seem, and I may add that the Qatar canadian school is governered by the Ministry of Education and offers neither arabic nor Quran at this point, but do offer french as it is the second language of Canada.   _____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Amoud, what you are telling... Amoud, what you are suggesting to everyone (not just the original person who first posted the question) is that the school fees at most (or all) schools in Qatar are very reasonable. Or maybe you are saying that if the school fees are a bit high, then it is not a problem at all because your company will always pay. Many parents are not in this happy situation, Amoud, and sometimes there is a BIG gap between what your company is prepared to pay and what the school expects you to pay.  Your comment about "climbing the waiting list" assumes that you have in fact been given a place on the waiting list. If you bother to look back at previous postings on Qatar Living, you will find that plenty of parents have been told that the waiting list is full for the school of their choice, so how can they "climb" the waiting list?  Just in case you have not noticed, Amoud, again and again on this forum there have been postings about which schools in Doha are the best. Compass, DESS, Park House and Doha College have frequently been mentioned by parents as being some of the best schools in Doha. Guess what? They are all British schools and a British passport, though not compulsory, is highly desirable if you want your child to go to one of these schools. The American School also has rave reviews and (surprise, surprise) the fees are probably the highest in Doha. Hence my comment about piles of cash coming in handy.
Again Hippo, has absolutely Again Hippo, has absolutely nothing to do with what the poster is asking. I am sure she is aware of the school fees if she is sitting for an exam for 2010.   The rest is nonesense as well. I have been here 10 plus years and my children have been given places in more than half of the schools you mention and we dont have British passports nor is our school funding coming from our company.   People who complain about not having a spot in school are the ones who wait until the last minute to register. She is registering for September 2010. If I do recall it is now November 2009, more than 10 months in advance.....  ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
School waiting lists "Please help. We are trying to move out to Doha from the UK this October, but are coming up against a brick wall with school places. Every school seems to be full with waiting lists. How on earth do you get your kids in to schools, especially those teaching Engliush curriculum. It seems to be impossible?"   I just came across this new posting today, Amoud, and it does seem to suggest that getting a school place for your child is not as easy as you suggest.   I am not an economist, but I do believe that there is something called, "The Law of Supply and Demand". If there is a shortage of something, the price goes up. This is what has happened (and continues to happen) in many schools in Doha, especially the British schools I have already mentioned.
Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hi Has anybody heard of any changes to the tourist visa rules,believe u cannot avail the same anymore from the immigration at the Airport and have to be done only thru the hotels.
RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes so what happens if you have friends coming to visit and stay with you?  They HAVE to stay in a Hotel?
RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes Hey if this is true,Hotels are going to hike up the already very high rates and make a bounty at the cost of residents who want to get their relatives over here for few days,fail to understand we want to compete with UAE in all other matters but in this case we go in the opposite direction,this is not fair MOI is not helping residents but the hotels to do business at the cost of residents.
RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes Tourist Visa headache. I went down to the building opposite the airport the other day to try and get a visa for the mrs. As i walked in I was surprised to find that there were only two people in there. When I went there in June the place was balls to the wall with bodies. Anyhow, I politely went up to the females who sit and process the visas, the freindly lady sent me over to the opposite desk to the not so friendly official who is suppost to stamp your form and check your documents. Now when i walked in the building this guy was obviously on the dog big time however, when I came walking over he was suddenly overcome with work and far too busy to be arsed with the likes of some expat who's looking to bring more expats in the country. So he looks at me with distain that would topple a camel and tells me the form that I've just 2 hours ago downloaded from the net is no longer valid and they've changed the rules. Obviously i should have known this information, he was somehow bemused that my world didn't revolve around the ever changing Qatar visa system and the fact that i didn't know the changes that had been implemented only last week he could not comprehend. He then bamboozled me with some number and name of a travel agent of the name he said so fast it sounded and i actually wrote down Quarabatra travel, it was only later after i repeated this to the woman at the end of the qtel directory enquiries that i found out he was actually saying Cleopatra Travel?? This company were even less helpful than the visa official. bottom line, if you want a visa you'll have to get one through the hotels but there is always a loop hole and being a Brit we always find em.. The hotel will get you a 30 day visa so if like me you want your tourist to stay at your place just get the hotel for a night. also that way the hotel gets to clean your bed sheets after you haven't seen the mrs for 2 months, its going to get sweaty.  Cheapest hotel i found was the Intercontinental QR1000 +19% bulls**t charge
RE: Tourist Visa Rule Changes if true, good news. reduce some ques. he actual need will go to hotel.

Resident visa Hi All.  I will travel to Qatar in a month fro Europe in order to join a company. How long does it take a resident visa to be issued? Can someone rent accommodation without a resident visa? If not whare can he live?   Thanks
If the company you are If the company you are starting work with is in any way decent, they should have temporary accommodations for you waiting for your RP to be processed. If not think twice before coming over here. It may be an indication of how they treat their staff.
Answer to the Point.... It may take 2 to 3 months for visa to be issued. No rent without visa. You can stay in a Hotel or of course company arranged accomodation. Good Luck and welcome to Qatar.
Better to check first your Better to check first your accomodation before travelling to Doha. If your accomodation allowance is included in your salary package then you will stay in the hotel on your arrival hence you cannot rent till you got the Residence Permit and this is required also for the application of your bank personal cheque to support the monthly rental.

RE: can i back to doha If your visa is cancelled by your sponsor,than I think you can not come. There is a restriction in computer in immigration........first check! Or you can come back at the same (old) sponsor's visa.
RE: can i back to doha with business visa no problem but u cant change it to rp
RE: can i back to doha If you are coming under business visa no problem but to change to any compnay you can not do, otherwise you need to get no objection from your previous company, but after two years you can back here in new visa.
RE: can i back to doha Qatar is not only the place you can work.Try your luck around the world and after two years you apply again here.
dont purchase Hello everybody  Please read my great experiance.  If you are purchase any items from the LULU CENTER you would not get any guarantee because they are not the responsible person and they will sent you to the real dealer.

Work Visa and RP I am an American with a job waiting in Qatar. I have been told Qatar is not giving any Americans work visas currently. Is this true? Can I expect Qatar to give visa and RP at some future point?       Thank You
RE: Work Visa and RP Don't believe every rumor you hear. Why would the State of Qatar stop issuing work visas to Americans? If you are qualified for the job and your experience and skills would certainly contribute in the country's continued development, then Qatar would surely be glad to have you here.

Visit Visa Dear All,  I want to bring one of my friend under VISIT VISA who was my class mate in Philippine. But could you tell even though VISIT VISA  is only for 1 month, is there any possibility to EXTEND VISA at least for another one month. If anybody can help me in this regard, highly appreciate.  Thx.
it is..... If visit visa as u r saying not business or work or whatever ... then u will have right in 6 months even it mentioned in the visa one month . after ure friend finishes medical and that should be before the first month gets expired . wait for result after u can extend it in jawazat by paying 200 Qr. for every month of extention up to 6 month . if he wants to stay for the 7  months he will take  air ticket of the last day of the 7th month its easy. for u to extend u will need original passport visa copy and debit or credit card. hope this helps u. good luck
You cannot bring your friend You cannot bring your friend on family visit as it is only for direct relatives.
there is a big difference to there is a big difference to a FAMILY VISIT VISA and VISIT VISA ONLY...  1. family visit visa can be extended for up to 6 months.  2. visit visa is ONLY VALID FOR 1 MONTH.  you cannot also sponsor your friend on a family visa... immigration in the Philippine airport is very strict when it comes to both visit and business visas...
humanresources.doha /-a-t-/ humanresources.doha @ cant i renew the VISIT VISA before it expire in one month? is there any possibility?
u can get it easily listen u can get it easily then u can extened it till 9 months... firstly! visa will b valid for one moth...if u want to extend then u must have to go for medical check-up...then after clearing medical check up u can extend straightly till six months..it will cost u 200 Qatari Riyals per month..... then after finishing these six months.. then only ur real work will start, to after officers to get it extended
yes,it can renew for another yes,it can renew for another 1month...pero base on my experience you need to exit ..either sa dubai or bahrain ..airport to airport lang nmn yun...and most impt..your friend shld bring plenty of money to survive ...:-)  i agree withyou ,mas safe kung visit visa nlng..kc pg business mas complicated.,..
Visit Visa I guess its a Business Visit Visa The released visa shows one month but it can be extended to onother two months..a total of three months..or tawag ka lang sa akin 55790168.
better get the business Visa better get the business Visa

RE: Car Registration how did you do it the last time? Do the same way this year as well.
RE: Car Registration You can renew your registration any time, they are concerned with the fee, you just go directly to the inspection place, pay 75QR and they will inspect your car, once it is finished and passed, then process the insurance and go to Traffic Police.  If you will not renew till the expiry date, it has one month grace period also.

health fitness center (gym) can anyone give me a good heath and fitness (gym) location situated in an around lulu hypermarket or al hilal or mamoura area.
RE: health fitness center (gym) I'd stay away from fitness first. It's a purely about making money, more so than any business.  While you are waiting inline for people to finish using equipment, you will see new people being given the tour of the place, when it is obviously over crowded already.  What's fitness first's answer? Come when it's not so crowded. HAHA. A Gym that wants YOU to work to THEIR timings.  Other than that, they have a lot of anti consumer policies, you cant cancel unless they take another month out of your credit card, they etll you you get a passport to use anywhere (but in reality you have to *apply* for it, and it's only for 30 days).  Just drop by & see how they try to muscle you into taking the 1 year package no matter how much you tell them that you'll only be here for 6 months. Don't believe the transferable stuff because the responsibility is completely on you to find someone to transfer it to.  Also, parking in city center is hell. I could go on & on & on like how pretty much everyone there is paying a different rate for the exact same thing.  I'd look for a good gym in a hotel. Make sure you go to these places on the same time/day of the week you plan on going to get a real

RE: Best serviced apartment in Doha for expatriates ? I have read a lot of complaints on Ezdan towers. I wonder ho's the current situation. Any alternative ? Al Fardan seem great (European/Italian design) but I do not know if there is avalability.
RE: Best serviced apartment in Doha for expatriates ? Try Beverly Hill Towers in West Bay.  Quite a lot of families living here, no shortage of playmates!  Good location as well.

can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family to visit me here? I have an RP now, and am getting conflicting answers from my company. So far they have said that they can pay for a visa on entry, then they said that they need a family visit visa - so which is it? They are only staying for about 10 days.
RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... Conflicting answers my result from confusion about which nationalities you are inquiring about. You need to specify their countries of passport.
RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... From your profile, I understand you are British. I assume your family members coming here have British passports.  If this is true, then let them come and they will get the visit visas from the airport directly stamped onto their passports. Each visa will cost 100 QR per passport and is valid for one month only. REMEMBER TO TELL THEM TO BRING A VALID CREDIT CARD AS IT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN PAY FOR THE VISAS IN THE AIRPORT!  If you wish to have them a resident permit (to stay here with you for more than that period) then you have to apply for  resident visas, which you can simply do after they arrive, if you wish.  Don't worry, they will have no problems at all in entering.

RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... The last stateement about needing a credit card to pay for the visa at the airport is not true. I came here for a month in march and paid by cash then moved here in june, again paid by cash. Not everyone has a credit card! You can also renew the visa after one month for another month costing the same 100QR.  Good luck and hope your family enjoy the stay.
RE: can anyone confirm if visas are needed for my family... Dancing Queen,  If you say you did it without credit card, then this is new to me.  When I entered Qatar last year for the very first time, I offered cash and they refused any payment unless it was made by a credit card.  At the passport authorities, when I applied for my wife's visa, they also insisted on paying with a credit card. They even had machines that produced disposable credit cards for the value of the fee that were used once if the applicant did not own a credit card.

diamond earrings or gold earrings??? hi guys!    I am planning to buy a piece of jewelry, but i want to know which is better for investment.. gold or diamond earrings?thank you for your inputs!!
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? The best investment is yellow or white gold because they are having a very good resale value. Diamond is not having a good resale value, every year its value decreases by some good percent. So better to buy gold and best shop is Damas which u can find at many places in Doha. Hope this can help u out :).
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Diamond , don't have any resale value,  Go for old whatever it is??????????  Best of luck.
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Have you not heard the statements like " Diamonds are forever " and " A Diamond is a girls best friend " ?  Well diamonds are forever since, when you buy a diamond, you have to keep it forever , as its value reduces in an exponential manner and it makes no sense in selling it at 10 % of its price.  Secondly how do you know that the gold that you are buying is pure ? Back home they may just refuse to buy it back or ask for a 8 % discount on listed price.  Besides Gold will soon drop to about 800 $ per ounce in the comming months, so why buy at all ?  I sincerely feel that Silver has to do a lot of catching up so would buy Silver bricks if possible , I feel it will give better returns than Gold in the 10-12 month horizon !!  Cheers to you while you make the decision.  If you are buying as an ornament go for gold-- If you are buying as in investment -- go for Silver.
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? Go for jewelry that is yellow gold and without gems nor stones. White gold is nice, but it has a cheaper market value than the yellow gold.
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? of course gold..
RE: diamond earrings or gold earrings??? For investment, both are OK if you invest like this.  Gold - Buy gold block from the famous shop with certificate.  Diamond - Buy loose good color (E), clarity (VVS1)and Carat (0.5 - 0.7) with certificate. Don't buy one carat diamond which is double price.  If you want to have good return, you have to invest quality one. Good luck in investment.
