from DUBAI to QATAR i am currently working here in dubai and i got an offer from qatar company.. they offered 8000QAR +camp accommodation +meal and transportation is provided by the company... will this be enough to accept the offer? how good is the transportation  there in qatar?
Hi If you are single then its ok you can enjoy.
depends depends on where the accommodation is.. how many people will live with you, what kind of food.   Why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more as accommodation and food allowance.    Most importantly, 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depends on your job profile and work experience.
If the company is from Oil If the company is from Oil and Gas Industry or working for that Industry, then their accommodation and transport will be better. If it is normal construction company, they dont have good facilities.  As far as your question of salary is concerned, you dont need to ask, as Dubai is not so different from Qatar and the currency is also the same.
Transport in the city is a Transport in the city is a nightmare.
And life her is so relaxed And life her is so relaxed that bachelors are excluded from many venues on 'Family Days.'
It basically means 'sharing'. It basically means 'sharing'. The bathroom, the kitchen, the bedroom. So, privacy adieu.
If you're here to work, eat, If you're here to work, eat, and sleep. No problem.
like you share your room to 4 like you share your room to 4 persons.. you got no privacy at all...
Camp is temporary. So, Camp is temporary. So, possibly porta cabin.
I have Filipino friend, I have Filipino friend, getting 5000 QR and he has his family also with him and 3 yrs old kid. Don't worry, you can manage.
ok... thank you again... ok... thank you again...
8k ++ is okay eeyouth. just 8k ++ is okay eeyouth. just ask about the camp accom. if it's porta cabin and you are used to this then good. if not, then ask them about housing allow. but if your work place is in messaeeid or ras laffan, better take the camp accom. these places are far from doha.
hehehe grab it and meet me in hehehe grab it and meet me in ramada heeheheh
The camp at NDIA is not too The camp at NDIA is not too bad. Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities.  Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max. Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal!  If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.

Weather in Qatar in december Hi all, I'm coming in 2 weeks to Doha and I was wondering how's the weather in december. Should I bring winter clothes? Jacket? Coat? Wool etc... I can see in the forcasts that it can go down to 10deg sometimes but this doesn't mean much since there's a lot of factors for example 10deg Celsius is ok in Boston but if you go to washington you're gonna freeze in 10deg C TY
RE: Weather in Qatar in december dont have to bring a coat, light jumper / cardigan would be fine.
RE: Weather in Qatar in december I dont know the exact degrees but to be sure as they say it is indeed very cold at that time.Bring winter clothes as an advice..,,,,
RE: Weather in Qatar in december Temperature at night does drop around 10C. Yes it does feel cold here when it is 10C especially if you go out. There is no heating in the house here so you gonna feel cold.
RE: Weather in Qatar in december Average night temp during December will be around 13 to 15 degC. Warm track suits, woolen pullovers/fleece would be fine.  It will be very cold(below 10 degC) from Mid Jan up to Feb end.

Theres a whole cadre of people who have never liked the anatomically impossible dolls squeaky-clean image; some of us even suspected there was a kinky woman inside. Now shes becoming the straight mans/lesbian version of Toms of Finland; the one-time ideal of feminine perfection is all but wielding a whip. Oh right.

http://qsa.gov.qa/en.. Found!  http://qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm  War looking for peace, is like fornication looking for virginity.
be careful what you wish for there has been much press lately about the drop in prices, food, and especially housing prices have been decreasing.  So if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowances and salary right now, you probably won't get very far, maybe even have allowances decreased!  There is something called the Qatar Statistics Authority at http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm   May be helpful, but not sure.  The English spelling in their reports is atrocious, they even spell literacy wrong!  Makes me wonder about errors in their methodologies and data collection if they can't get even that right.
well, discussion has to be well, discussion has to be based in something with an official "smell".  I checked QSA and it reports for -4,6% (supposed the data from Gulf Times comes from here).  So this year I will pass on the issue without noise. Lets talk next year :)     War looking for peace, is like fornication looking for virginity.

Near Shahniya The Arab Agriculture Center out the Dukhan road near the  Shayniya roundabout, they have tons of houseplants and outdoor plants that are very healthy at reasonable prices. Worth the drive out there if you need more than one plant, huge selection. Recently bought tons of petunias and some poinsettas as well.
THE ARAB AGRICULTURE CENTER I like the arab agriculture Center... many kinds of plants can be found ...still can bargain for the best price ... and delivery at your home with very nice conditions.  try it..you'll like it

When you climb the flyover that is after you pass the Sheik Faisal Museum take immediate right and come back 500 meters on the service road (Parallel to the main road) it is next to Shahaniya Sports Club. You will find a small board Arab Qatari Agriculture company something like that. The timings are 7.00-12.30 & 2.00-4.00. I'm not so sure about the afternoon timings. They also sell some fresh vegitables that they produce in the farm. You will find variety of plants there. They are also cheap compared to the ones that you get here in Doha. I went there a couple of months back. hummmm... need to go again..
Thanks deecee. I know there Thanks deecee. I know there is such a place at Shahaniya but never know the name and the exact location. Will check it out but just in case I lost my way, is there any telephone no. for this company/center that I can call? Thanks!

RE: Outside Catering My friends child celebrated her birthday at KFC last sept. They brought some spaghetti, rice noodles and macaroni salad.  They allow them to serve it there.
RE: Outside Catering "Cental Cafe" in The Center has a very good karekare, and native desserts(cassava cake). You can also try "Orient Express's" foods, they're good, they have egg pies and brazos de mercedez too. Branches are Al Sadd, Hyatt Plaza food court and Muither.

Good Bank Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha

RE: Good Bank INTERNATIONAL BANK QATAR IS THE BEST BANK HERE IN DOHA SAD STORY ABOUT OTHER BANK'S...
RE: Good Bank DOHA BANK....THE BEST
RE: Good Bank If you have time and you're a patient  person, please go for HSBC. It takes in average 30 minutes to reach someone when you call the customer service! And if you call after 5 PM, after waiting 30 minutes they will ask you to call the day after.  Another one from HSBC, if you travel abroad, they may eventually block your credit card (for security reason) and will inform you only when you are back in Qatar. I was left in Thailand without being able to use my credit card and didnt had a single $ to buy food! Thanks to HSBC.  I moved to Commercial Bank (CBQ) and I'm very happy :-)
RE: Good Bank I recomend HSBC
RE: Good Bank united bank,ltd. --- d best customer service even if its a small bank
RE: Good Bank I just closed my account with HSBC yesterday. They're bunch of theives and liars. Any transaction you want to make will cost you minimum of 50QR. I DONOT recommend HSBC at all. I joined Al AHLI Bank and Im very happy with their services. At least when you call someone will pickup the phone.
RE: Good Bank HSBC are shocking!  their customer service is horrendous, and when you travel abroad they block your credit card, even when you advise their card services department which country you are going to and which hotel you are staying in! also, if you call their customer services from abroad outside of office hours, it goes through to their UAE call centre, who say they cannot help until the Qatar office opens again!  useless, absolutley useless.

Thank you very much...
RE: Is it is allowed for a lady to bring her husband in... No you cannot - not unless he is terminally ill and dependent on you. You can bring him here on a visit visa otherwise. Women can bring only minors or dependents on family visa.

JUDO I have been looking for months for a judo club.  There's a federation here but when i contacted them they couldnt really tell me where i could find a club for my son.  It seems that judo is taught here in schools but only for qataris!  There must be a club somewhere in Doha that accepts non qataris.    Does anyone know of a judo club, my son is 5 years old.  thanks
RE: JUDO There are few martial arts centres here in Doha. There is one behind Ramada Hotel and at the back of Mega mart,   there is also one opposite the Jarrir book shop
RE: JUDO Thers' also one in front of Rawnaq in Bin Omran area.
RE: JUDO Thanks for re-opening this question. NO! There is no private JUDO clubs except the federations without proper motivations for their players.  The closes thing that I saw is the one near to Frinje Naseer area. It is Jujitsu Club. As you know Jujitsu is the first cousin of JUDO.  I think I will enroll there, cause I am become rusty as days passby.  They are open in the evening.
RE: JUDO Good Day!  Finally I found a Judo Club that started accordingly more than a year ago. The Dojo is under umbrella of the KARATE ACADEMY in Al Sadd Area near to Jarir Book Store and Doha Clinic Hospital.  The Timing of the practice is SUN-TUES-THURS at 18:30-19:45 under Coach Saeed who is a former Qatar Olympic player for 12yrs.  If you are interested you can contact these nos: 4421142 or 5220806.  Enjoy the art of Judo.   Good Luck.
RE: JUDO Dottymum, Sorry for the late reply. I teach judo at a school, and no, your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise, the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players, because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them, there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors, and if your game to learn (or already know) French, I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know, and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.

German Engineer with PhD, salary? Hi all, I am seriously considering moving to Qatar. I've just finished my PhD in civil engineering (Geotechnics), I have only 1 year experience. I am German.  How much should I expect in Qatar now? Do you think it is better if I work here in Germany for like 5 years before i relocate? Starting salary for civil engineers in Germany is about 10000 QR, so not really much!  Best regards
Sorry! I'm not acquainted with German work environment, but the whole thing looks like a joke to me.  You are a civil engineer who dedicated at least 5 post-graduate years (not working in parallel) with no point or project behind your Ph.D. thesis other than getting the certificate!!!!!! And still you think that European degrees are better than Egyptian for instance.
Moreover A Ph.D. civil engineer is expected to have the same starting salary as a B.Sc. holder!! Never to mention the expectation of the field work; is he supposed to be a site Engineer for example? Isn't he supposed to be working in the research field? With this starting salary for a Ph.D. Emg. in Germany, I'd recommend you'd better apply to a job in Egypt.
Check out the following Check out the following sites, www.gulftalent.com and www.bayt.com, and then apply to any engineering positions that suit your qualifications. Try to get some offers first and then come back here and ask us whether the offer is good for you or not. Good luck!
contrary responses Thank you all, I got contrary responses, some say 30,000-40,000 QR others say PhD is like BSc and "German PhD means nothing in the world anymore". Could more members of this forum verify one of these statements? by the way, does working in scientific research  count as work experience? I mean I spent 5 years in laboratory doing experiments for my research, can I say I have laboratory experience now?
Just take it easy You can't claim that your PhD = PhD + 5 yrs experience, jsut like that 5 yrs experience <> 5 yrs experience +PhD.  You can consider that PhD = BSc + 3-4 yrs experience.  Makes sense?  As for the Egyptian comment, I don't know why he took the matter so personally?  Finally, never mind the Yank, LincolnPirate.  He's under 18 anyway so take his opinion for what it is worth.  If your going job hunting, use your biggest guns.

what's the deal with paintings? We are moving to Doha in the new year. Someone mentioned you are not 'allowed' to have pictures of living things in your home. Is this right? Do i leave paintings of living things (even animals?) at home? What can I expect?
loisstella, someone was loisstella, someone was having a laugh at your expense.  No such restrictions.  --------------------- N.O.W --------------------------
loisstella no issues concerning paintings here in Doha...
Lois, there are the Animal Lois, there are the Animal Painting police that come round to your house at night doing random checks. Be afraid. Be very afraid. I had a photo of a Pekanese in my wallet and the beat me in a cell for five days....   No, actually Im being horrible. Labda is right, Qatar is a very friendly country in general bar the roads.   All the best and welcome to Qatar!
I have a big picture of my old boxer dog.. These are all myths about pics you can bring any piture you like.. But refrain from nudity or sexually explicit just incase you get stopped at the airport.. In your house you can have what ever you like..  Infact I read in the questions that a guy was selling Erotic lamps..lol  ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS <a title="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"><img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/125x125_ql_round_badge.gif" alt="Everything you need to know about li
No such rule.. I keep a painting of the missus over the front door.. Keeps hawkers away..
of course you can hang up of course you can hang up what you like in your home. The person that said that to you , must have misunderstood it. what he/she means is, it's not allowed for a believing Muslim to have paintings of living creatures , that is forbidden for the Muslims.  But most Muslims don't even know that.
Paintings I believe that in the strictest terms Muslims should not display images of anything that has a pulse.
britexpet.... maybe your britexpet.... maybe your right and I'm wrong, but the Muslims I know , have no knowledge of this , or don't understand the seriousness of the matter wa allahu alim.
I think yes, you mmmm...  I think yes, you cannot have pictures of animals, except the birds in the qatari notes, the orix that is everywhere (for instance in the logo of Qatar Airways), the falcon pictures...   War looking for peace, is like fornication looking for virginity.
What about the photos in the What about the photos in the passport?
What agencies we can hire a car and a driver? I am loooking into hiring a car with a driver, have heard some agencies here in DOha do it...any tips??  Many thanks
Eurodollar My experience with Eurodollar:  I asked them about what happens if there is a minor scratch. They say that there are sometimes charges of 20/30 QR. A few weeks later, the car needed to come into service. The car had small scratch on front bumper. They make a big deal of it even though I am pretty sure it was there before I hired it. After service, they did not mention it and I took it out for another month. Next day they phoned me saying it would need to be charged at 450 QR! I tell them that they are taking the piss and ask to speak to the manager. A man phones later and insists I pay it claiming I need things like police reports etc - when I refuse he tells me to return the car. I say no problem if you give me back my money for the month I have hired the car. I suggest he comes into work and picks up the car. He does not come in and does not phone again.  Next day, car has a problem and won't start (it has lots of little problems due to poor servicing). They come out with new key but take much longer than they said they would. The same guy finally turns up with another who looks threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch. I tell them my feelings that it is minor but he makes a big deal about needing to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody doing the job for 100 QR (as I thought reasonable) would not do a good job. He says that as I am such a pal he will reduce it to 350 QR and that he will pay the remaining 100 QR. Basically, I have to agree to pay or there will be no new key.  I take the car to the main dealers and they quote 100 QR!!!! I believe that it is not likely that the main dealers for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it comes to spraying.  I suggest you avoid Eurodollar as they are trying to squeeze money out of any opportunity... Even worse than the other car hire places I have tried.
Try these drivers Idriss 5466780 Abdullah 5902595 Mussa  5284966  or Fox limousine (call 180 for the no. )

Master UBC, you can do that Master UBC, you can do that any day, any time...My post is about a once in a lifetime chance to invite people you would not be able to see ever again...So, please stick to the game.
hiii Dear nomerci, my answer is till same, why i invite them?? because i ahve this opportunity to, and why i wouldn't invite those like others mention is, if i would invite them i would have a reason to learn something from them, to ask certain questions from them or what else it could be, but if u see all those i wanted to invite have given all there knowledge through books, so why would i invite them? i dont find a reason for inviting them, am not a big fan of personalities rather prefer the work they have done.....i hope u understand my point but i know u never satisfied by any of my replies n thats the thing i like about you :-)
well, if you view inviting well, if you view inviting poor people as a once in a lifetime opportunity, well, I find that rather disconcerting....

Xbox 360 Owners!! A quick question I was just wondering whether or not Xbox 360 games sold in Qatar were NTSC or PAL? The reason is I own a PAL console and so hopefully Qatar games are in PAL.  PS. If you own some games brought from Qatar and don't know you can just check the back of the box and see whether or not it says PAL or NTSC.  Thanks in Advance :)
virgin tend to be PAL only. virgin tend to be PAL only. other places like SAQR stock a mixture, so be sure to check the label on the top right of the cover.
you can find both NTSC & PAL.  Regards!!
You can find both here Toffe. You can find both here Toffe. I have a PAL X-Box bought in Virgin, other X-Boxes bought in different shops are NTSC, so you are safe here either way :)
Also you have the option of buying on the internet and have the games delivered to you here in Qatar via Aramex.  Regards!!
Both are available Both are available
ok thank you very much for ok thank you very much for the quick responses :) PAL games galore then :P

Dual Sim Mobile Phone Hello Can any one answer me!!! Dual/Double Sim card mobile can be used in Qatar? Does Qtel have any policy regarding this?
RE: Dual Sim Mobile Phone Qtel have no policy on which mobile to use. You may use which ever mobile you like either single sim or dual sim.
RE: Dual Sim Mobile Phone sure man...u can use. qtel dnt hav anythin to with that. dual sim handsets r available in qatar market. i kno one model in samsung.
RE: Dual Sim Mobile Phone Thats easy to answer. Its YES!!...Samsung is selling a model that has Dual Sim Capability (dont know th exact model,and I saw it in THE MALL) so it means theres no problem using a Dual Sim Phone. Technically. you have two numbers in one phone.as opposed to having two phones for 1st for ur roaming and 2nd for your Qtel/Vodafone number.
Pray Before Eating Everyone was seated around the table as the food was being served. When little Logan received his plate, he started eating right away.  "Logan, wait until we say our prayer," his mother reminded him.  "I don't have to," the little boy replied.  "Of course you do," his mother insisted, "we say a prayer before eating at our house."  "That's at our house," Logan explained, "but this is Grandma's house and she knows how to cook."

american churches I need help to contact American or Baptist Churches in Doha
Why not just answer his Why not just answer his question ?  He wants to know if there are any baptist churches in Qatar ..
No but there are Americans No but there are Americans that could possibly be baptists.......that go to church.....but probably not to a baptist church in Doha.......
The Anglican church of Doha The Anglican church of Doha is where most "english'speaking people go to in doha. Their church building is still under construction in the Abu Hamour church complex.But their services take place in Doha English speaking school(DESK)near Markhiya round about. Entry to the place is restricted and Qatar police will be gaurding the gate always. so if you want to go you have to call the pastor and inform him so they will add your name to the list with the police. If you need the phone number just write back.
There are no Baptist churches There are no Baptist churches as such in Doha.  Only a handful of Christian communities are allowed to have recognized, sponsored, full-time clergy, and the Baptists are not one of them.  The Emir graciously granted land to the Anglican church to lead the various independent Protestant Christian communities in Doha to contract a Protestant center.  Most Baptists and evangelical Christians I know tend to go to the non-denominational Christian communities such as Doha Fellowship and Grace Fellowship.  Both have webpages.  Like the Anglican church (and much of Qatar for the that matter) services are conducted in English, but a fair number of participants do not speak English as their first language.  Hope you find what you are looking for.
Stay away from questions Angelina. If you can't help just don't answer my questions. Whatever happened to our sense of help
thanks. And for these folks, i say thanks for your responses. britexpat, frenchieman and saptakalran

international driver licence Hi, I am coming on tourist Visa, while waiting to get my residence permit. Can I drive using an international driver licence and for how long?? (I found some old info on this but want to get an updated picture)..thank you very uch.
Depends whose car you want to Depends whose car you want to drive
International driving licence International driving licence usually vaild for 12 months from date of issue, and yes you can use it..I did for 3 months until my RP came through and I got my Qatar licence...
You should always have your You should always have your normal licence with you too. an International licence is not a licence in the truest sense of the word
Yes you can. Go to Traffic Yes you can. Go to Traffic dept. and apply for a temporary license. until you got ur RP.
International Driving Licence You can drive on an international driving licence for 6 months in Qatar.  However, as soon as you get your RP, you have to apply for a Qatari Driving Licence as driving on an international one then, becomes illegal.

where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not paying more than 300 riyals per month i have a male gray persian cat and im travelling for two monthes and i need to leave it in any place if some one can pls take good care of him for taking not more than 600 riyals per 2 months pls answer is u are interested pls call 4474065
RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... 25 of June he is 1.7 year old and he is very well behaved
RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... The average kennel cost is 35 -45QR per day. However, you need to book in December to get a place. Doha Vets have just opened a new facility, call them on 4367187, they may be able to help you, the price will be less if you can find someone who is prepared to share the cage with their cat (if and only if they get along well). Also check with QAWS, they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the going rate, competition for cages is strong at this time of year.  There is a lady who will visit your house daily, change the litter and feed but it is very sad to leave a lone cat for a month, if you consider doing this why not offer a home to one of QAWS many cats looking for a home? Then, you can leave the cat knowing he will be happy and also giving a home to a cat who really needs it. jj
RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... Sorry - QAWS don't do boarding! We're a rescue shelter only.   If you're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that.  2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2,400. And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him.
RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... Your cat nutered.

Best places to look for work? Hi, I am currently looking for a security based job in Qatar. As an ex British soldier, I can adapt and learn very easily and with my past experience I will be looking for a reasonable salary. Can anyone recommend any companies that I can apply to please?

Thank you for your response. Thank you for your response. I very much appreciate it. I know what a reasonable salary in the UK/Europe would be but unsure about here in Qatar. What do you think a reasonable salary would be and package? I look forward to hearing from you.  regards
It is my impression that any It is my impression that any security job in Qatar will be extremely low-paying when compared to a UK salary.  Mandi
Agree with comments made by Mandilulur as any offer will be well below the salary for  similar work in the UK. Add to that the cost of housing and other benefits such as health care and it really becomes a no-brainer.
Well, just let us know what Well, just let us know what is the minimum salary you expect and I'll let you know whether you can get it here or not.

Checking the history of the Car How can one check the history of the car like maintenance, accident or service history.  In every advertisement of the car, people used to write "Accident Free", but in most cases, car have at least one or two accident, which is not easily detectable through Car Inspection Company. Share your opinion in this regard.
RE: Checking the history of the Car Sith Lord - is it true that someone can lower the milage by tampering with the car fuse box?...
RE: Checking the history of the Car We had just bought a pre-owned car. We were looking for cars and if we finalised we had got it checked at German Auto Specialist Center on Salwa Road. From there we had found out that many of the cars had minor accidents and had touch up done to them. German Auto Specialist Center also do a full techinal computer checkup of the engine and check the condition of the engine, cylinders, car stability,etc.   Their Ph # is 468 7377. They are open during Ramadan after 7p.m.
RE: Checking the history of the Car A good experienced mechanic or tinsmith can easily detect body damages even if it has been touched up professionally;  Bring one for inspection
RE: Checking the history of the Car Sumtimes minor accidents u may not come to know ..get the car checked by any good mechanic
RE: Checking the history of the Car u can take the person along with you to trafic police to get the full accident history.
RE: Checking the history of the Car depends on the owner of the car..if she/he reported the accident/s i believe u can check it to the traffic dept..but some owners are not doing that especially if its only a small accident..try ur luck and go to the traffic dept..
RE: Checking the history of the Car How about those who claim a low mileage by tampering with the car fuse box ? In my sense if you're not able to detect traces of an accident then it is probably not worth mentioning...For best results buy a new car :)
Is the TV signal in Qatar Digital? Is the TV signal in Qatar Digital? Is a digital set top box required. If so will a UK set top box work? I have a spare one in the UK and wondered if it was worth bringing to Qatar with me.  Regards
As far as I know there is no As far as I know there is no terrestrial broadcast in Qatar, everyone uses satellite pointed at Arab Sat and Nile Sat etc. So a digital terrestrial receiver attached to an aerial will not work. You can by a cheap satellite decoder from supermarkets etc to receive free channels; otherwise you need to subscribe with QTel for a package, like OSN etc. Find details on QTel website.
"A major new survey by Arab "A major new survey by Arab Advisors Group reveals that terrestrial TV still has a solid audience base in Qatar with 45.1 per cent of households stating that they tune into it." http://www.ameinfo.com/126396.html Either you are misinformed, MWA1, or the Internet is.
Qatar TV. Lots of Bahraini Qatar TV. Lots of Bahraini and Saudi channels, too. But, you can get them all via satellite except the English version of QTV.

I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. I just lost my wallet, somebody stole it in my back pocket. Is there any way i can retrieve all my id's and license? nevermind about the money.. all i care about are my id's.. :(  I really thought those kind of people doesn't exist here in Doha.. :(
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. there is a different route to retrieve each type of i.d. for the qatar i.d. you first have to report it missing with the capitol police station which i believe is by souq waqf. after 7 days you go back and they will give you a paper to go and get another i.d. for the driving license, go to the traffic department that issues these, pay 100 i think it is and you'll get another one on the spot. just remember to take your passport and any other pertinent i.d. to each of these places so as not to make a wasted trip. this happened to me before, wallet was stolen out of my locked car!
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. Congrats!!!!!!!!!!  just apply for new one... 100 bucks..
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. Those kind of people?? Those type of people are all over the world. Especially here in Doha. There are more thieves here then most places around the world that have been.
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. Maybe your stalker took it.. lol
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. BLOCK ALL CREDIT CARDS AT ONCE . Secondly, you can ask for duplicate HEALTH CARD/DRIVING LICENCE FROM http://portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/homeAr . While DUPLICATE QID you can get it from SOUQ WAQIF, Airport, Mesaimeer Branch of MOI service stations . Be careful next time as CORRUPTION and poverty is increasing day by day in all parts of the world
RE: I just lost my wallet in a Shopping Center.. Don't listen to Da Count! Doha is a great place, it's just that sometimes things like this happen! It's people like him that probably stole your wallet. I am sure the police will be more than helpful to retrieve your valuables or at least assist you in gaining new ones. Da Count, your people are known for stealing things, so you should be more sympathetic to this person.

'Fashion tat, in english:) . 'Fashion is the healthiest motivation for losing weight' -KL . . .
.. sorry.
tatess, main forum ;) get the gift back and ask for refund (from the recipient) ;o  tatess, main forum ;)
so Its better to gift the gift certificates instead of gifts itself.. so this way they can choose the gift they WANT.... and no more unwanted...:-)
tatess... I would just do what you suggested!!! ... but then I am bold and say what I think, which is more than can be said about many people around us. BUT I sure would confront the person. Maybe you can enlighten us as to what the unwanted gift is so we can bid for it too and embarass the person who has hurt you? (insert big grin here!)  "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind"
I would get really angry I would get really angry first then I would laugh about it and eventually I will ensure that the gifts I give to that person in future are something that person really treasures..        <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
just ignore.... and promise not to give him anything...again..
you gave them the gift you gave them the gift because you care about them and wanted to make them happy. The gift should not be a burden on them and sit unwanted and take up space. What is the harm if they sell it and buy something they really need or want? In a way it is still from you and they are happy as well.
ill do nothing, as i gave it ill do nothing, as i gave it from my heart. appreciated or not, it doesnt matter
Astrogirl, no apologies please.... ... I would be hurt if I was you.  I have been given the most strangest things when I left work in Abu Dhabi, before coming here. I have kept them, shipped them here to Qatar AND they are a mismatch on my shelves. But you know what? They make this place unique and special, because each thing brings back a memory of a special time AND person. I would NEVER gift something that has been given to me as I do not have the guts or morals to do that. But we are not all the same - and trying to make money of an unwanted gift is sad and shows what the person who it was gifted to is really like.   "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind"
Sonaam, you could then give Sonaam, you could then give it back to Malrat who could then give it again to the ungateful and original recipient, it could then go round in a circle until we all get dizzy.  Do you ever get presents that you are sure the giver received themselves as a present - I'm sure there are lonely objects like that floating round the world destined to be unwrapped and wrapped again and again...  Now here's your part of the deal, cuz. Lay the secret on me of Man's Red Fire.
If you gave it to a philipino .. i can understand that,, There are like that,, do anything for a buck,, even sell there ols grandmothers teeth from the grave,  Rules are a guideline for intelligent people, but they must be adhered to by idiots.
ITS HURTS, BUT YOU JUST GIVE ITS HURTS, BUT YOU JUST GIVE AS A GIFT? SO DONT MIND DEAR. (is this one you are talking about) it's an unwanted gift to me as i already have E71 and W705 for myself so if any1 interested....can let me know their offers through an SMS... on ??????? and if its a good offer we can set up the deal n this lovely mobile is all yours !! the mobile is black in colour and not even opened the box....for more details follow the link below  " http://www.gsmarena....

TB, you always amaze me with TB, you always amaze me with your confident yet ignorant answers, especially when it comes to the immigration issues. Of course ladies are allowed to sponsor their husbands. At least there is no a legal limitation on it. Yes, it's is much more difficult, than husband sponsoring his wife.. but it IS possible. It depends on few factors, and each application is considered by the authorities on case-to-case basis.

Post Offices. http://www.qpost.com.qa/ for all details of postal service.  Also the PO just inside door of Lulu D-Ring Road is handy and helpful. In my experience mail to Europe, UK, USA, Bangladesh is  reliable but sometimes a little slow.  Ordinary letters to UK, USA, Europe, do not need registration but for some other countries it might be advisable to avoid problems at the delivery end.

No more Visit Visa? Can someone confirm if this is true? A friend of mine just told me that they are no longer issuing visit visas to anyone. Two people have already mentioned to me that they dont issue it anymore at the Airport office. What about the immigration office? Have they stopped it there too?
That is true Arien, however That is true Arien, however i'm told that they do make exceptions to certain cases but that all depends on wasta :P  Silence Mj dont make me take out my bat!

Depends on the nationality Depends on the nationality of the subject. There are some nationalities which are "frowned upon" by the Qatari government (due to political reasons). Jordanians, Iraqis, Palestinians (from abroad) and indians too as they always try to regulate the ratios of nationalities in the country.
Cumbersome this rule was Cumbersome this rule was actually passed just a couple of days ago so it seems. I'm talking about visit visa being stopped completely for everyone, not any specific nationality. Both persons that told me this went to the airport branch. So its possible that they are no long issuing visit visa there. But its still available at the immigration office in Gharaffa?

How to Calculate The Distance between us to The Thunder Light ? At October - November in Doha, there will be transition from summer to winter. There will be a lot of Thunder / Lightning / Flash. How to Calculate The Distance between us to The Thunder Light ?
RE: How to Calculate The Distance between us to The... <img src="http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/lighthun.gif" width=350 height=180 />  <b>Explanation:</b>  Calculate how many seconds when you saw the flash of lightning, until you hear thunder   then divide the value by 3 to know the distance in Kilometers or divide by 5 to know the distances in Miles   <b>Example: </b> You see flashes of lightning, 12 seconds later, his voice booming.  So the distance of lightning by yourself is 12 / 3 = 4 km (approximately )    When the flash light, at that time we also see it immediately, because the speed of light is very high, 299,792,458 meters per second. There's almost no delay to reach our eyes.   But, the speed of sound "only" 331 meters per second. As a result, some time after the lightning lit, the new voice boomed.   Therefore, the distance of lightning with thunder listeners about a mile every three seconds. Thunder is rarely heard at a distance of more than 25 kilometers.  <img src="http://u.kaskus.us/3/mfibgiyr.gif" width=250 height=150 />  Good Article... by Aikon

Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? Hi everybody,Somebody hit my car , the back side bumper is damaged, So I told police and they asked to come later. Will insurance pay my loss? I have a third party insurance. Thanks in advance!
RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? nope . dont think so
RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? no. you have to pay for the repair after you get the police report since your insurance is t.p.l. only
RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? WeLl I dNt ThINk So..
RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? If you the culprit you can get from his insurance if not then you have to cough up the cost yourself..
RE: Somebody hit my car / will i get insurance? If you dont know who hits you, then you are responsible to go to police dept. to make a report for the damage and you'll pay 110.  They will check also if you have any violation (if you have, sadly you have to pay it or else you're not gonna get the report). Since its only TPL, sadly (again) you will bear the expenses for the repair.
cheerios??? can you find cheerios in Doha???
Don't get me wrong doody. I Don't get me wrong doody. I myself have honey cheerios at home which I on occasion eat cause they're quite tasty. What I meant to say, though it didn't come across properly, was that the advertising campaign that Nestle cheerios has is over exaggerated.  Companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their products have to convince consumers to buy them. Like expat sueno says, they are a bit healthier than the other stuff out there but at the same time they're still not that healthy. Anyway I don't mean to be a diet Nazi, you should eat what you wish :) Oh and I have to agree with Doratheexplorer, I'm not sure about giving cheerios to a baby you'd have to check up on that.
Cheerios I saw them on sunday in Megamart
There was also some at There was also some at Shoprite.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
cheerios The Honey Nut Cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at MegaMart - at least when I go.  The regular Cheerios are more difficult to find, but they do exist.  (Buy them up when you can find them!)  Keep in mind that the Honey Nut Cheerios have a lot of sugar (9g per serving) compared to the regular Cheerios (1g per serving) http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar  They're not as bad as some other cereals that target kids, but they're still quite sweet.
thank you all for the thank you all for the inputs... i hope i'll get to find those regular cheerios
Cheerios and Honey Cheerios So funny that you asked because I've been looking for them for a while too.  Here's my info:  1.  Regular, plain cheerios:  I've only found them at Megamart.  And they cost like 23 riyals for a very small box!  2.  Honey Cheerios (from Nestle):  These are available at just about every grocery store like Family Food Centre, Food Palace, Lulu, Carrefour.  They only cost around 13 riyals for a box.  Hope this helps.
I was going to write the I was going to write the same thing as NY couple. In Family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerios which do well on the taste buds but are a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyals.
Oh and don't buy into that Oh and don't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereals advertised. They're all still pretty heavily processed. Best healthiest thing to do for breakfast is eat as much protein as you can - hence eggs are highly recommended.
you're right to an extent, villagejoker Cheerios are processed - absolutely.  However, on an overall basis they're much healthier than most of the other garbage out there that is marketed to mums for their babies & toddlers.  The sugar content of plain ol' Cheerios is also far lower than that of sugared cereals and other snacks, which are generally even more processed than Cheerios.  Some of the sugared cereals are up to 50% sugar (by weight - and more than that as a % of calories).    Even some of the yogurts have more grams of sugar per serving than a full-sized can of Coke, thanks to all the added sugar (and high fructose corn syrup).  Plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt does contain natural sugar, as does fruit, but nowhere near the sugar levels of the typical "fruit" yogurt here in Qatar.  Nothing is ever truly perfect in the snack food world, but we can strive for "the best we can find". . .I just try to read the labels and use common sense :o)
Rizks Cheerios is a cereal name brand.  I'd check Mega Mart.  There are many western products in stock there.  Prepare to pay out the wazoo for them though!
Buy a cheap acoustic 2nd hand guitar in Doha Hello everybody,  I'm looking for a 2nd hand guitar here in quatar,  I'm a beginner so I don't need a really good one, but just one in order to practice usually.  Thank you and regards,  Kidi
if the body is cracked, you if the body is cracked, you wont get the accoustic effect. i had one which i broke by accident and then the sound quality dropped..
that is exactly my issue... that is exactly my issue... It's a pity but usually it depends on the length and the depth of the crack, so maybe there is still hope...
There is a shop in Bin There is a shop in Bin Mahmoud near Bonanza Restaurant.. On the same road opposite side of Bonanza, there you can get cheap acoustic Guitars for around 300 QR.
kidi, if you really have kidi, if you really have interest in guitaring, i would suggest you buy a HOBNER..

My quoestion is can i go with cancellation by having a properti (CAR)under my name.  Please advise on this please.
Sell the car to concerned parties in what ever condition, cancel your card at traffic dept .. go out with clean record .. as you came in ..
Mr_Qatar, well said, but the Mr_Qatar, well said, but the problem not with him, with many others. never saw comments helping the op related to the subject but just trying to be smartars.  one of the biggest reason why I hate Qatar, environment maturity is below the low!!!!
YES Yes you can leave, as long as you dont have a loan (money) from a bank. Your car will be just towed sometimes. It is not a big problem
Agree with mr_qatar. Smfaham Agree with mr_qatar. Smfaham is trying to get some information here and u should respond only if you hv any information on the topic. This is not Facebook where your irrelevant n funny replies r going to get likes from people.  Smfaham I would suggest you check with your company PRO, he/she may be able to guide you with the exact procedure if any.
yes even i think that u yes even i think that u should check with the traffic department as it will be better if u clear ur debts prior ur departure or else they will make issue at the immigration
IF NOT MORTGAGED, LEAVE IT. you may leave your property here as long as you have no financial obligations/Debts for acquiring that property.  If you have doubts, you may ask the staff working in traffic department.   Move on!!
"one of the biggest reason "one of the biggest reason why I hate Qatar, environment maturity is below the low!!!" Implying Qataris even use QL.

termination from company Hi,    please advice me,    my company terminated me,then they are ready to give Noc if i got new job. the problem is i having a car loan and credit card payment,, what is the procedure?i am searching for new job..any problem to change sponsorship? Please help me to give right answers..  Thanks and Best regards
.... lesson: live with what u have and don't take loan if it's not for emergency reason coz as expat, u can never be sure of ur status here in qatar.  all u can do now is to look for another job but if ur not lucky to find one (hope not) then u'll be in big trouble!
The only problem you will The only problem you will have is you can't get your final exit from Qatar until you get an NOC from the bank to say that you have paid back your loans.   If you can't get a new job you might have to borrow money from family back home to pay back the loans here, otherwise things can get difficult.
Friend you must be lucky as Friend you must be lucky as they decided to give you NOC to join some other company,,,if they refuse to give NOC and decide to deport then what u do?,,othewise...???...all the best to find job and secure urself...
hi Thank you very much for you advices.. actualy its car loan,, if i sell my car it easy to pay back loan.am hardely search new jobs,if i changing the sponsership should i need to pay back all loan? let me know
what do you mean when you ask that if "you change sponsorship you still have to pay car loan?"  A loan is a loan no matter what and it has to be repaid in full. Now if it's a company loan for car then for sure they'll take it from your end of service payment (or as much as they can).   If it's a bank loan then notify the bank immediately that you have been terminated and let them know you are actively searching for a new job in order to be able to repay the debt.  Best of luck!!
Nothing fatal! Find another Nothing fatal! Find another job and keep paying your loan, what's the problem? Loan and credit cards have nothing to do with your sponsorship. Unless your company cancelled your RP... then your current company must inform your bank, and they will simply freeze your account until you find another job. Nothing extraordinary. If you want to leave for good, you will have to pay off your loan. Then sell your car and close the outstanding balance, that's it.

"Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Furniture price wise, which one is offerring lower price? And quality wise which is better?
RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? <b>HOME CENTER</b> Quality very good but prices are quit high . Sorry, don't know about HOMES R US
RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? wanna cheap, go to Najma. Then you have to arrange the transport, which avaliable arround you there. I'm not talking about quality over there.
RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Both are the same standard. Decent Quality and decent prices (on sale).  Try out this new furniture shop in this new mall come up adjacent to la cigale hotel - al saad.This mall has benetton, BHS etc. On the first level is this furniture shop - it had great looking furniture (The one, id design standard but with home center prices). I have already furnished my place but this is one recommended buy. Doesn't have too much of choice though but since it is a one off shop there are high chances of you do end up having the same furniture as your neighbour (which is a high probabiliy with home center/homes r us)
RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? I think they both are having the same quality ... mostly Chinese or Veitnamees ... it depnd on the materials .. if it is solid wood or rubber wood then it is diffirent from MDF and so on ...  now u have a chance to buy from Home cemter because they have special offer ... buy 250 and get 50 .   according to ur budget u will be able to move .  I personally prefer home center which I furnished my house here and back home from it .   they have more branches and more options to chose .   good luck

Driving through when green signal is blinking, will get fine? I am new lady driver and today is my first drive from home to office. When I was driving home, at the CID office junction, the green light was blinking when I already driving through about 2 meter when the light turn yellow then red.  Am I gonna get fine QR6000 for this ??? Please your kind advise if you ever had this experience.  Thank you so much.  Nervous Mom
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... If u didnt see the flash then there is nothing to worry, Its very common for motorists to pass through the signals when the green light is blinking  But if you saw a flash then there will be a fine
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... YOUR ARE SAFE DEAR. BEST OF LUCK
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ...  So, If you've crossed the lights while anything but red, you are good.  Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly.  You can pass through even on amber, but it is just not worth taking that risk.  Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... Nothing to worry.  You are safe now.
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... No, if it flashes, you ll be fined...
RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... Hi,If you are so worried you can check if you have violated,go to the www.gov.qa and check by putting your car registration and your Qatari I.D number.Personally I think you are safe.My best wishes

can wife sponser husband if he loses job My husbands contract will be terminated soon. i am currently on his sponsership( dependant visa) working in senior position. can i sponser him and my children if my company agrees to change my sponsership from his to company,s ? What is the procedure for this? kindly reply thanks
RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job Yes you can sponsor your kid and husband provided you meet the necessary criteria of FAMILY VISA set by qatar government...Your salary should be sufficient enough (as far as i know, it's been increased to QR 10000)to have your kid and husband on your visa.  Kindly ask your company PRO for the detail procedure...
RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job hi.. i doubt if a wife can sponsor... maybe for nurses or doctors..better ring the immig/labour office,,,
RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job If your company has no problem sponsoring you, then it's okay, but check the company policy. Your company hr will be able to guide you better in this regard.they will know the process of doing so.
RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job yes you can sponsor ur husband and kids.  you need to first change to your company visa before he loses his job, so that you will save time in this. for this you just need his NOC and your company's willingness to accept you.  then you have to prepare all necessary documents to do the sponsorship transfer of your kids and then husband.
RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job It will be difficult

Doha fridge magnets.. Where can I find Doha fridge magnets (Obviously the one with the word 'Doha' or 'Qatar' printed on it)? I've been collecting fridge magnets from countries I've been to but unfortunately I haven't had any success looking for this kind, not even in Qatar Duty Free. Any idea? (:
RE: Doha fridge magnets.. There is the stall in Villagio outside Virgin Megastore that sells them.  It sells all the arabic furniture and doors and stuff like that.
RE: Doha fridge magnets.. Another place that was not mentioned was the duty free shop at the airport.
RE: Doha fridge magnets.. oops...didn't catch the last line in your post.  The duty free shop used to carry them but maybe not anymore.  Now I feel useless...I am not 100% sure but I believe seeing magnets at the Giant Store in Hyatt Plaza.  It is on the second floor in the far left corner pass the toys where this man there sells lots of different souvenirs.  I hope this help...:)
RE: Doha fridge magnets.. You will get them in Souq Waqif. There are lots of souvenior shops in there..
RE: Doha fridge magnets.. there's a souvenir shop in landmark and CCD, It's exactly the same shop where you can buy postcards... I've seen some of those in Souq Waqif too, you might want to check that area by yourself. goodluck!

hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy? hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the affidavit of support in philippine embassy?
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... actually sir i am asking for a family visit visa for my cousin. they said that there is no available family visa right now thats why they just give me a business visa for her.so do you think they will authenticate the letter from my company and the immigration oficer will accept this one?thans sir alexam.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... @lizkat. Family visit visa is only applicable to immediate family members such as husband, children, parents and siblings. Your cousin is not your immediate relative. So you cannot apply for a family visit visa for her/him.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... so it means that even if my sister will have the same business visa they will still refuse to give me an affidavit of support. thats so sad. i just wanted them to be with me for a week or two so we could be together.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... What you need is your passport copy and residence visa copy. The passport copy of the person you're sponsoring. To be 100% sure call the embassy 44831-585 and 44836-871.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... i already called there sir. unfortunately they didn't gave me the requirements because they said that it is only for family visit visa.i need it for business visa of my cousin.do you think they will entertain me?thanks so much.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... I see. You're in a different situation. You don't need an affidavit of support since your cousin will be on a business visa. What you need is an assurance letter from the company or person that granted the visa regarding the stay of your cousin here in Doha.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... PE will not issue u Affidavit of Support. They will only issue the said document to those who were given visit visa under your sponsorship. They will also ask for a copy of MoI visa printout.
RE: hey guys, anybody who knows the requirements for the... I have nephew came here under buseness visit visa,he produces only letter from his relatives proves that he has relatives in Doha, with relative passport copy,visa copy id copy and relatives employment contract.and, with another file  is the sponsor letter, visa application, printed visa from the moi website.that all.at his first check-in denied and off-loaded and went home hopeless.We rebooked and finally boarded the plane without any problem or interview.

RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? dont know why that answer has come up here!
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? I think the best 4wd is TOYOTA land crusir
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? hi, go for toyota land cruiser , great resale value, and space as well.   if your budget is less then go for Chevy TAHOE or YOUKON. both are looks good, powerful engine and space also .
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? The BEST off - Roader, 7 seater to my knowledge is TOYOTA LAND CRUISER!! no doubts. Ultimate Power for Sand Dune rides and climbs silently. Even has the best resale value!
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? You can go for KIA Mohave it is 7 seats + within your budget basic price is QR97,000. High performance engin 280 BHP, 4X4 drive very good in dunes.
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? for a hundred thousand you could get an Xterra...amazing off roader with 4L engine and 250 bhp at your disposal...but it is a 5 seater...6 seaters start at 126000...the Prado 2.7L...I am not sure of the american and korean brands though...but I think the Ford Edge is pretty cool...so is the GMC Acadia...
RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? GO FOR THE GMC ENVOY XL. ITS TOO GOOD AND MAINT WONT COST YOU MUCH.

Tatsky signals Let me know from the user of 'TATASKY receiver', whether they  face any problem with the signal quality during the day time. Now-a-days, in the day time the signal is so weak for the TATASKY RECEIVER.    Do you all face the same problem or the signal is good for you in day time?   If the signal is good, please suggest a technician for me.    Regards/RK

Some Most of the replies are so funny. When the guy is asking a simple question answer with relevance. No pal Tata Sky does not work so well during the day due to Solar Disturbance. Dont listen to the QTEL's self proclaimed spokesmen who speak only crap. Nothing will happen if you use Tata Sky. I dont find it illegal at all since it does not air porn channels but pure family entertainment. Secondly its  been registered and paid for services. There should be no harm using it as long as you dont bother QTEL. QTEL should not be bothered as they provide useless TV channels in Doha, unlike in Dubai PEHLA Network is facing losses due to customer switchover.   If it is illegal, then please talk with facts where in Qatar QTEL pulled out the dish antennas for Tata SKY. No one cares. Dream Box is still flooded in the market and that should be something QTEL should ban as its a portal for obscene channels..
yeah easy easy... agree yeah easy easy... agree signal is poor looks like they cut down on their signal strength or else pehla or qtel is interupting the signals cause they r loosing buisness. As you said calling a technician is of no use.   Aana free, jaana free, Pakde gaye tho khana free.
yes.. signals are very poor yes.. signals are very poor in day time.. screen frozen for logn time. and yes.. tata sky don't care about it.  their motto..  jisne lagaya tata sky.. uski life ka kar do jhinga lala.  if you want to watch dvd quality picture and sound.. better get a dvd player.. tata sky is useless.  winner never quits and quitter never wins.. does it means that only one person will win all the time?
check it out t_coffee.. in check it out t_coffee.. in india they don't give a dam to customer...  they are too busy doing "jhinga lala" to their customers.  winner never quits and quitter never wins.. does it means that only one person will win all the time?
We have got a TATA SKY at We have got a TATA SKY at home...  It does have DVD quality picture and CD quality sound throughout the day & night..  Signals r well above the required level and the service never gets interrupted... Our location is near Al-Arabi stadium... The signal quality depends on the surroundings... Ours is a villa and there is no TOWER or higher buildings which block the SIGNALS...  HENCE, HAPPY VEIWING all the TIME...

Doha Airport v/s Doha Malls Are the items inside Doha airport (Duty Free) cheaper compared to those that are sold inside the malls?
Rizks, it was a Question not Rizks, it was a Question not a statement. So answer if you know about it...:-)  "It is better to be hated for what you are than being loved for what you are not."
oh ok, my bad ! i read it oh ok, my bad ! i read it wrongly !!  i think its cheaper in Duty free but not Much of a difference. <a title="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"><img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" /></a>
No, I've not noticed the No, I've not noticed the price being cheaper in Duty Free. It's just more convenient, almost same price and on your way out plus weight does not count to your allowed limit.
for alcohol/liquors yes it for alcohol/liquors yes it is cheaper in duty free.   <em>&quot;How far you go in life depends on you being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, tolerant of the weak. Someday you will have been all of these.&quot;</em>
I think the perfumes are I think the perfumes are cheaper too, not sure on that one, but at least they're genuine ;-)
Gold is cheaper in Duty Free Gold is cheaper in Duty Free than Gold Souk?????  lol
borloe,  have you tried borloe,  have you tried bargaining?  it's a tried and true method to get a better deal, Duty free doesnt offer that option
ITS TAX FREE IN DUTY FREE, ITS TAX FREE IN DUTY FREE, LIKE for ex Liquor in QDC is 82QR(75cl) in Duty FREE is 45QR (1 Ltr). perfumery, confectionery and electronics is cheeper in dutyfree...
my fellow QL'ers,a my fellow QL'ers,a comparison can only be made between a REAL duty free & a mall,QDF is an excuse,"real" airports have duty free shops so in keeping with that,they've thrown together the basic booze,chocolates,cigarettes,which if you walk fast enough past the security check or blink hard,you'll miss altegether,so really if we are to compare,do it between say dubai or Abu Dhabi or Bahrain duty free & the prices in the hypermarkets/malls...

depends on what u are goin depends on what u are goin to buy,  last year i remember and purchased in qatar duty free was canon 1000d which i took for 599$ (2,190qr). in carrefour that time its price was 3,499qr. not bad!!!

Definitely, absolutely Definitely, absolutely cheaper in QDF.  Buy your perfumes and cosmetics there which is 30% cheaper than local market.
Have the rules changed that I Have the rules changed that I am unaware of? Otherwise, why would anyone be worried about alcohol prices of Duty Free if youre still not allowed to bring it into Qatar? I wouldnt buy alcohol on an outbound flight because you can certainly buy it cheaper at your destination.
Yes it is Yes it is
Perfumes and Cosmetics are cheaper in the Duty Free shops Perfumes and Cosmetics are cheaper in all the Duty Free shops compared to the local market prices. It will be 15-20%  cheaper through out the Duty Free shops in the world. Food items and confectionaries might not be cheaper in many cases. Electronics are cheaper in the local market.
Last time i checked Last time i checked electronics were priced more than what they are in local hyper markets and malls. Alcohol was cheaper and that's all that matters :P  Good Fortune always comes knocking at your door...when you are sh*tting in the toilet!! :) <p> _[]~<strong></strong>~[]_  </p><p> <img src="http://www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif"
Yes electronics are Yes electronics are expensive in Duty Free. Can't compare alcohol prices as no alcohol available in Doha Malls ;)
perfumes and make ups are perfumes and make ups are cheaper in duty free... esp. liquors  <b>"BRING IT ON CHAKA DOLL!!!"</b>
Basically, Duty Free is Basically, Duty Free is never any cheaper than stores out in the city.   In Doha, the only exception is alcohol...the price difference is however marginal: about 10% vs. QDC.
Why would you buy alcohol Why would you buy alcohol from duty free in Qatar? I think Alcohol would be cheaper at the destination than Qatar Duty Free.
I just returned from a trip I just returned from a trip to Dubai, and bought a perfume on the way out. It was 237QR duty free, which was much better than the cheapest price I could locate in the malls, at 314QR (some shops were asking up to 400QR for the same item).
laboheme We lived in Abu Dhabi for a few years and were fascinated by the fact that tourist buses from Dubai arrived at Abu Dhabi Co-op to buy goods at cheaper than Dubai duty free prices. Dubai duty free was cheap at one time but not so now I suspect.
nope Unfortunately they aint cheaper compared to malls. also watch to check on the warranty, as they have funny system of warranty system if bought in duty free. so electronics not advisable in duty free... BUT, goodnews is that, the alcohols are 50% cheaper in duty free compared to QDC :-D.... lol.. enjoy and remember to drink responsibly (dont spill it)
chocolates.... chocolates are way more expensive in Duty Free than in stores. cosmetics, cheaper in Duty Free. those items are the only ones i checked.
Oh.. Not to forget the root Oh.. Not to forget the root beer.. ( those school days..) :-|
Yes it is cheaper in some Yes it is cheaper in some parfums. And there is nice collection of toys and chocolate. But I'm not sure about the price. But for me it is cheap, good idea to buy some to your child to be quiet.
DT God NO. The very definition of DUTY FREE reads 'Premium' and 'Exclusive' and hence the pricetag to justify.
yes I know for fact that the makeup IS cheaper..  [img_assist|nid=7232|title=Dua|desc=Amen :-)|link=none|align=left|width=440|height=56]
cheaper in the airport duty free gold is cheaper in the duty free than in the gold souk...

Family visa application question: Hi Guys...  Till today morning my application status was showing as under process on the MOI website for family visa. Now I checked at 1 pm and it still shows under process but in a different way and also shows expiry date, application date etc...but the visa number is not there! Does this mean I have to go to immigration to pay the fees?
Family Visa Hi Dear,  Wishing you Happy New Year 2012.  Yes you have been allotted with Visa but its still undergoing few formalities like Final Signature from Signing Authority and Security Clearance. You should go to immigration department and show them the application receipt. They will let you know the exact status. Once everything is done...the status will be changed to "Ready for Printing" and later you can get it printed either from MOI website or get the printed copy from Immigration Dept. Hope this answers your question. All The Best.
Family Visa Documentation Question Hi Friend,  Please follwo the link: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2364185  Hope this will help you.  Regards
Truthteller: You need to Truthteller: You need to submit the following docs  1. Family visa application form 2. 6 months bank statement 3.

Mine got accepted without attestation but generally attestation is required 7. Attested marriage certificate
I got the visa number today I got the visa number today on my mobile (through metrash) but when i try to print on MOI it says "Sorry..Visa not printed yet". Is this because they did not charge the amount when I submitted the application?
Visit visa for Pakistanis Kindly someone tell me, specially if there is someone from pakistan, is there any visit visa available for pakistanis?  i have asked many travel agents in pakistan,but they say they do not deal with qatar visit visa/no visit visa available. I am almost shocked because UAE visas are so easy to get, why not qatar visit visa for pakistanis?
Ok Guys come to the point Ok Guys come to the point again, i am not dissapearing anywhere nor am coming on tourist visa. I want to come on a visit to find job there in qatar. but unfortunatly, it seems there is no visit visa available. Why is that, how would i come then? Uae visas are so easy to get why not qatar. Please guide me and show me some way to come to Doha
The reason it's difficult is The reason it's difficult is that visit visas are not issued for the purpose of coming to find a job. Mandi
Yes, thats the problem with Yes, thats the problem with Qatar, unlike UAE, they do not offer visits for job search.
QATAR TOURIST VISA I think Cozmo Travel is providing Qatar Tourist Visa. They are located near to Crazy signal in B-Ring Road, Doha.  Contact: 44073444 Email: info-qatar@cozmotravel.com
/-a-t-/seasound101 did you @seasound101 did you get success regarding visa or get any new info regarding Qatar visa process...?  @ jovi I visited their website they only offer Qatar visa for UAE residence :(..
Simple No need to go here and there, simply go to Qatar Airways office anywhere in Pakistan (Available in all major Cities), pay return ticket with 40$ tourist visa. within a day you will get it
No, I am in saudi arabia No, I am in saudi arabia since last december and have a job here, but still considering doha as an option now, the rules in ksa are getting tougher by the day. i think the only way to get a travel visa is to contact a qatar airways branch in pkistan.
Possible You can get visit visas but you should have any blood living in Qatar. Otherwise, you have to apply for tourist visa through Qatar Airways and have to pay for hotel accomodation as well.
Well, yes, it sort of depends Well, yes, it sort of depends on why you are coming to visit, doesn't it? If you have no relatives here, it's kind of suspect. Mandi
If you just want to visit as If you just want to visit as a tourist then you can contact the Hotels direct in Qatar and they may be able to organise a visit visa for you.   Else follow the advice as above.
visit visa about visa   you can apply here  through hotel then u will get it or u can apply through immegration.idont think u will get it from pakistan
I guess Qatar are worried I guess Qatar are worried that pakistanis will come on visit visas and then disappear, never leave their country and never go home.
Where they can go @ Mozaismyhero:  Well, where one can disappear in such a tiny state, in desert? I guess, you are underestimating Qatari's CID and Police. They won't let anyone to disappear easily.

NBA Western Conference Finals LA Lakers vs. Denver Nuggets  Which one do you think will advance to the NBA Finals?  I'm sure this will be a very interesting series considering one fact that Chauncey Billups made a big impact on the Nuggets line up.
Lakers 4-2.. Lakers 4-2..
Is it a LA Lakers ?  Is it a Synchronized Swimming Team ?
No Doubt LAKERS will win this series... Go Lakers!!!
No Britexpat that's the US Cheer leading team. I think I saw them in a movie once...

Finals Lakers will advance to NBA finals...  But then again, Lebron and the rest of the cavaliers will harvest their great season...  The only team in NBA history to win their first 8 playoff games with a double digit margin (at least 10 points)...   RESPECT
the conference finals won't the conference finals won't be an easy journey for cleveland, afterall they will have to play Orlano after they defeated the celtics in game 7 at Boston! and with a 19 point deficit! Again, first time in history Boston would lose a game 7 playoff game!!!  Sorry I meant first time the lose a HOME game 7 in the playoffs RESPECT
Lakers for Finals Yey! Lakers won...!!!

shiny you can check with JAPAN EMBASSY here.  check with SPEED if you want to start one.
Since this didn't occur in Since this didn't occur in the subcontinent, there won't be much interest hereabouts for charity and relief efforts.

dont no dont know, if there is inform me too..
shiny You may want to add thermal vests to that - it is freezing and snowing now. How many rucksacks can one family donate and have you got somebody to fly them over?
Yes as many rucksacks u can Yes as many rucksacks u can manage I guess. We've been trying to locate something like this (donations for Japan) in Doha and so far this is what has come up. The US base is organizing them to be brought over.  Hope to reach the people in the tsunami hit areas where everything they have, have been washed away and destroyed.

Now, its been two days but i am still waiting. Howlong does this procedure take? and what should i do about it if they cant find it? Thanks
RE: Lost baggage I assume you reported it to the office in the baggage reclaim hall. Phone them up and ask for an update. Our bags came out on the following days QR flight and were delivered to our villa that evening.
RE: Lost baggage THAT IS GAY, only my wedding dress was 289$. They better find my luggage otherwise they better pay for it
RE: Lost baggage This week heathrow has had some baggage system problems due no fault of qatar airways. If you have reported to QR on arrival here they will chase for 5 days then the search will fall to a central desk for matches based on your description. Contact them t ask hw match is going. Good luck - heathrow is very tempremental !!
RE: Lost baggage oh btw, if you don't get your luggage try or threat to sue them... they hate messing around legal department..  if i were you, i won't just accept 100$ settlement..  but still pray you get your wedding dress..

My CDs were confiscated at Qatar land border Hello.  We just realized that our lifetime CDs of photos and weddings were missing. It was 2 months ago after our boxes were land freight to Doha from Dubai. We tried to contact the custom authorities, our shipping agents, and ask how to go about to claim it back. So far, we haven't had any luck.   Does anyone has this experience before? Would love to hear from you and your comments.  Thanks
That's terrible.  How do you That's terrible.  How do you know that they were confiscated?
That is SAD... That is SAD...
They like to watch them They like to watch them first, so if you had a lot it will take a while for them to give them back.
Thanks for the comments. I am Thanks for the comments. I am hoping that someone can give me some advice how and where to claim this item back. This is the first time we ever ship through land freight. We always used air cargo in the past and our CDs went through just fine. They questioned us, but never confiscate. The guy who we dealt with never informed us verbally nor in in writing about restrictions. The drivers didn't care whether our things were confiscated. Anyway, it's not that important to blame anyone. I just want to get my CDs back.  Most of our boxes were torn apart. We lost all of our medicines even children vitamins and other things. However, we didn't mind as these can be replaced. Our lifetime photos cannot unfortunately.

Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? I moved to Doha three months back. I want to know from where can i drink alochol in cheap rates. I went to ramada, W, they are very expensive. Secondly i want to know what if i am drunk and coming out from bar and going to my room. Means is there any problem for me as i am a muslim guy. I shall be very thankful if someone posts the suitable answer.
RE: Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? If you drink in bar or pub they put a stamped  in the hand. but have to be careful while driving go with a friend so anyone of u is more drunk the other can drive u safely  U can go to the distellary in Abbuhamor to buy drinks but for that u need a license.  drinking in open is banned here.
RE: Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? Bad boy ...
RE: Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? Take an Noc and salary certificate from your sponsor,  pay a refundable deposit of QAR 1000/- and get a liquor permit from QDC. Enjoy ur drink at home.. nothing to worry at all... just make sure that, u r not on wheels when drunk..
RE: Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? Brother remove this post.If a Muslim drinks he will be behind bars.
Consuming alcohol Could anyone please advise me, I have just been offered a position in a construction company in Qatar and I was wondering if you can buy alcohol from shops and bars or is it restricted like in other middle eastern countries.
Do NOT give yourself to the Do NOT give yourself to the Dark Side. It will only lead to ruin. Fight against it young Jude!
I might give the bars a miss I might give the bars a miss and try reducing what I drink in doors, are there any gyms I can join and do you know how much they cost
ianjude, all the big hotels ianjude, all the big hotels have gyms where you can get gym/pool membership. I think the rates start at about 6000QR per year,I'd suggest you have a look see, sometimes they have specials. There is also a large gym in City Center, but the parking is horror.
qdc permit do ask your company in advance i do know that there are a few companys out there that are not willing to give a permit to expats
"What has muslim got to do "What has muslim got to do with this thread"  1. Alcohol is restricted because Qatar is officially a Muslim country.  2. Muslims are prohibited (by law anyway) from having a liquor or pork license and are not supposed to be served at hotel bars.  We all know, of course, that many people find their way around it.  MODS--please take a note of this purposeful oversensitivity and baiting.   To the OP--it's easily obtainable, but expensive.

I don't care , they Babu? eh?  I don't care , they can do what ever they want...I just thought ianjude needed to know. that's all. And not eating pork or drinking alcohol does not make anybody a saint  IMHO. anyhow....let the nonsense begin....:P

don't know why some folks are don't know why some folks are hissing at the non-muslim bit..nomerci and others are right when they say its a muslim country with liquor restrictions..a muslim caught drunk driving is sure to be treated differently than a non muslim person..there's no need to be so sensitive guys..i'm muslim myself but don't see what xena and then the others said that was wrong
Me and my Muslim mates love a Me and my Muslim mates love a good drink, in fact they drink more than me!  Anyway I've seen qataris shopping at QDC in Thobes but who cares as long as they are sharing the joy liquid.
ok. what next? ok. what next?
I am a british muslim coming I am a british muslim coming from UK soon inshallah (god willing). even for myself I know I will have to adapt to the lifestyle in Qatar. Personally I think as long you follow the guidelines You should be ok.
as far as @ ianjude64  as far as alcohol goes....it is available at all the bars and night clubs in town plus u can purchase it for personal use at home by acquiring a liscence....quite a simple process and ull be be given an ID which allows to to purchase it.  hope this answers ur question
I AGREE WITH @ Bauchus  I AGREE WITH U THAT THE REACTION WAS OVERLY SENSETIVE!  But just to clarify...Muslims are not prohibited by law to from having alcohol although they used to be....now a day they r prohibited from acquiring a license to purchase it for home use but they still  can "LEGALLY" consume alcohol at any of the bars in town, many of which requiring memberships and none of which can legally reject any person for being a Muslim  I know that because what ur saying "used to be" true and it was abolished about 3 yrs ago and announced in all bars due to an insident that happened at Irish bar at Sheraton...since then all Muslims can drink legally if they choose to do so at any establishment
Thanks for the clarification Thanks for the clarification super cool.  It always struck me as impossible for hotels enquire about someone's religion before serving a drink; good to know they aren't expected to do it.
Question Just wondering if this guy would also need his company letter or NOC to join the gym or to go and play pool with the girls by the sea
krisp,..you need you make me laugh thanks for making my day ;)  i think it does help to drink a bit before driving in doha,.makes you more aware ;) ,.and your skills while being deluted with alcohol will be equal or still better then the other drivers surrounding your with there big suv's
I can understand the I can understand the Dutchman, the English, The German or even the American ragging on Qatar's streets....but the dude from "THAILAND"!!! No offence bro have u ever been outside in Bangkok or phuket???? Hehehe  We have 2 types of drivers in the Qatar.The formula one drivers.and the super extra accentuated gravely careful, lol.  The funny part is that the super crazy doesnt stick to the fast lane where they belong and weave in and out of traffic.and the super careful practically lives on the fast lane and wouldnt budge for the life of me :-D
supercool haha that was funnily true..the careful in the f1 lane and the racers in all lanes..although one could say that the racers are made homeless by the careful folk:-)

Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Can an Emirate National get an alcohol permit?
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? My guess would be no as you need to show your QATAR ID to get one
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Call QDC tel: 44699413
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Yes, you can get the liquor license if you hold a valid RP in QATAR. You just need a letter from your sponsor stating your designation with your salary (All Allowances Must Be Included), Copy of RP from your passport, QR.1000/- (One time deposit)..  Go to QDC, fill up the form, submit all the above. If approved, you will be granted the permit in 15min.
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? I dont think so brother
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? Of course assuming you are a muslim, I think you have no chance of getting a liquor license.  Not sure about Qatar, but I know of a friend of mine that has an Australian passport, but he is a muslim, and they refused a license to him in the UAE.  I would think unless you can provide proof to the authorities that you are not muslim, then you will have no success.   Of course, I could be wrong, but I doubt it in this case.
RE: Can an Emirate national get a liquor permit? are u out of ur mind?? dont u have a littel dignity or shame?? is this the image u want to give about muslims? if u a muslim dont follow ur religion and stick to it how do u expext others to respect u and respect ur religion and convince them about it???? sooooo shocked and ur from emirates????waw what do ur parents think???

Not only profession, his age, gender, background, mental condition, intelligence, emotional IQ, reflexes even his mood influences his/her driving. How many times have you made a general idea of the person in the driving seat who zipped past you wrong side without looking at him/her.

Transcuteneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator - TENS TENS means Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator. It is commonly used in Physical Therapy depts as a modality to treat denervated muscles like those in stroke or spinal injury patients. These are the ones you see with pads connected to the muscles to make it twitch or on higher frequency, to relieve pain. However, this machine should only be operated by a licenced physiotherapist with the supervision of a doctor. Untrained use of TENS might result to electrocution accidents.
Its also used as a pain Its also used as a pain relief during birth. Due to my work back home, I had one and loved mine :)
Seems I may have to wait for Seems I may have to wait for my vacation to purchase this, was hoping to get it before as it would be great for the long haul flights this summer.

can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in qatar? I am a civil engineer here in the philippines and soon be working in qatar? what visa should they be have? and how long is the processing? what are the requirements? thank you.
RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... Your contract should tell that your status should be family, and not bachelor, so that your family will be taken here to Qatar, with all expenses paid by the company.  Several companies are doing like that here in Qatar.  Of course, it will be better for your to be family status, since the beginning that you are working here at Qatar. Because, not only for monetray reasons, but if your company will shoulder the expenses, they will help you in acquiring the family visa.

RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... Thank you for your reply,, but my visa is only bachelor. If im going to go there first, will I be able to bring them in 3 months time at my own expense? My employer told me that they will help me out about that once I get there, but my question is, what will my first move in qatar? and what are the requiremnts so that before I leave the philippines we can fix all the papers. Thank you very much.
RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... you have to be in qatar before you can do anything. you have to wait for 3 months before you can bring your family here in qatar. its either by visit visa or residence visa.
RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... First you land in QATAR with proper visa and then think about your family.. The process to make RP for you itself will take 1 month..
RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... what do yoy mean by RP? is that the first step that i should take before i can get my family?

Anybody else moving out to teach in January? Hey there guys!  I'm moving out to Doha to start work with the Ta'allum Group in Doha as a primary school teacher at (I think!) the Al Maha Academy for Boys.  Is anybody else moving out there?  Does anybody know where they're supposed to be living yet?  I haven't had all the info from the school yet.  I wouldn't mind getting some topic info so I can plan properly really!
You should be quite You should be quite suspicious if the school does not provide you with the information you require. What kind of professionalism is that? Are you sure you want to deal with bloody amateurs?
LP exactly.. LP exactly..
the best thing to do is to the best thing to do is to contact them directly (HR) to find out the details. If they are not giving you any information, then... it gives you an idea about the culture of place you'll be working for...
Settled in yet? Hello Lea and Brewtality,  Are you two settled in yet and how was the transition?
Guys, guys the OP is not talking to you, the word used was "moving-out".
Well the offer of employment Well the offer of employment included information on sallary and allowances as well as the extras offered and info on what I am required to provide in terms of documentation.  I know how much I will be paid, the dates covered by my contract and all of that, I am just waiting for specifics on accommodation etc... I know there are other people moving out at the same time so was hoping at least one of them might use this website and might have received some of that information.  I know that I should not expect things in Qatar to be as efficient or transparent as in the UK but I have experience of working in other countries where that is also the case so like I said, I am giving the school the benefit of the doubt...
most schools would tell you most schools would tell you what type of accomodation they provide at least - for example single/one bedroom fully furnished flat.  Also, if they are an ongoing operation, they probably already have the flats rented and should be able to provide more particulars (i.e. photos).    As for getting paid, no matter the status of your residency, they should be paying you while it goes through the bureaucracy, reputable employers do that.  If for some reason you don't get an RP then they should also tell you what happens at that stage (repatriation at the school's expense).
Working for Al Maha Academy Hello   I too am to start work for the Ta'allum group at Al Maha Academy.  I did receive my contract and a little after that my airline ticket.  I had to contact the agency that placed me to find out who would be meeting me at the airport.  As far as to where I would be living, they only told me that they have 3 compounds.  Very vauge.  Are you starting in January?  Regards,  Lea989
I am starting in January I am starting in January yeah.  Have you gone through Academics?  My interview was in December and according to the agency, the school is waiting on a visa before sending me airline tickets.  Again, rather vague!  I'm sure we'll become well acquainted in the not too distant future.  Are you travelling alone or are you bringing children with you?  I'm coming from the UK (liverpool) by the way...
LP is right! I think they LP is right! I think they must have to provide info on that!

halal frozen beef meat how many of you buy or eat halal frozen beef meat.which is imported from other countries?
And why are you asking? And why are you asking?
anything related to mutton or anything related to mutton or beaf in qatar is halaal.
This is one good article i This is one good article i found on net.  Is Halal meat Halal?     The title of this article is a bit misleading. I do eat halal meat but only that which I have either slaughtered myself or from someone I know, trust and am confident can slaughter an animal properly. This may come across as a rather elitist viewpoint but it is only that - my viewpoint which I admit is more personal that strictly religious.   In my early years of Islam meat was just that, meat. I, like everyone else, simply looked for the halal logo on a packet of meat, the shop window or restaurant. I consumed a reasonable amount of meat per week. However things started to change. On one hand I started to realise that the phrase "you are what you eat" is literally true.  I noticed a huge difference in my health, outlook and religious state after periods of being vegetarian. On the other hand I started to question whether halal meat was actually halal. I wondered whether we could actually trust the butchers, the producers or even the slaughter man in the abattoir. I also questioned whether the intensive exploitation of animals rested comfortably with my understanding of Islam. I concluded that there was too much doubt involved and decided to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his noble family) to leave that over which I had doubt.   At one point my family had pretty much turned vegetarian. Meat rarely entered our house and the only time we ate meat was at friends' houses. Although vegetarianism is to be applauded and even encouraged, I do believe that some meat is healthy. All the Prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all Ibrahim (peace be upon him) offering the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of Hajj.   Upon moving to the countryside our ambition to produce, slaughter and eat our own meat finally came true. We used to buy lambs from farmers, I would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer. We even started to breed our own chickens. The meat was fantastic; not only did it taste different but it looked and felt different. The texture and colour of real meat!   One of the benefits of living in the countryside is that you meet people that work in agriculture; these are the people that bring us our vegetables and meat. Through speaking to them I started to find out some things about both animal farming and supposed halal meat.   Animals are exploited. If one sees the conditions they are born, bred and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart. Chickens lead miserable lives in huge sheds, sharing their space and air with thousands of others. They do nothing but feed and get fat as fast as possible ready to make their way to supermarkets selling them as "Value" meat or to a Chicken Cottage on the high street. Larger animals face similar problems. Lambs are pumped full of steroids to make sure they don't die, ewes with hormones so they give birth out of season and both feed on grass treated with insecticides. Cattle are sometimes born and bred in sheds; they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass.   Muslims need to ask whether this is something they are truly happy eating. Is it good to eat meat that is full of rubbish, that led a miserable life and a stressful end? Is it not possible that all this transfers into the meat? One also needs to ask if this method of farming sits with the ethos and spirit of Islam. Does Islam not teach compassion, kindness and does it not fight exploitation? To me both these elements make most of the meat in the UK inedible. I do not want to subject my body to such produce and I definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploits a community that praises Allah (Quran 13:15, 17:44 and 22:18).   Through an increasing interest in the whole area of meat, animal welfare and organic food I wanted to see whether local abattoirs would be open to me coming in and slaughtering animals. My talks and visits to some local abattoirs confirmed all my previous suspicions about halal meat in the UK. The first abattoir I ever called told me that there was no problem in coming and doing halal meat as they already had someone who did that. Upon questioning the abattoir it turned out that he man who did that was Muslim but did not slaughter them himself but processed them normally, meaning they were killed by non-Muslims. "He reads a prayer on them or something then gives them to us," were the exact words. Another local abattoir informed me that "all we do is halal meat". Again after some probing I found out that none of the slaughter men were Muslim. The abattoir had actually entered into a deal with a Muslim who was processing them in this tucked away abattoir and selling the meat as halal. As you can imagine I was shocked.   So as you can see, there are some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience. They are pumping out thousands of carcasses of haram meat to butchers and restaurants and you are eating it. However, my problems with halal meat do not stop there. I also question the hygiene standards of a lot of Muslim owned abattoirs. The vet at my abattoir once said to me that he has seen places in Birmingham that were "covered in shit". "How can you call that halal?" he asked me. My other issue is with the slaughter men. As someone who visits an abattoir every week and does between 10-30 lambs I know your mind drifts. It makes me question whether those that work as slaughter men full -time really remember to say "Bismillah - Allahu Akbar" or even pay attention to what they are doing. This is not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animals per day.   As a result of all this thinking, research and experience I have made an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless I know exactly where it has come from. I am not advocating that everyone does this as I appreciate this is not always possible, but to anyone who has taken the time to read this I would ask you to really question your relationship to meat. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are known to have made themselves sick upon discovering that the source of some food was doubtful.   A lot of my conclusions are purely personal. I wish modern day Sheikhs and scholars would address the issues of intensive farming, animal rights and what we eat. This whole area is sadly lacking and needs to be examined in order to give us some guidelines. At the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo. It is those that want something better, for themselves, their children and animals, that need to start thinking about the meat they eat and taking some tough decisions.  by Muhammad Ridha Payne  Thanks.

RE: Visa for mother in law Thanks Dima! Actually my family is under my sponsorship ( wife being a home maker). Is she allowed to apply for visa or i have to?
RE: Visa for mother in law your wife can sponsor your mother in law. the easiest way is to apply the tourist visa which is 30 days visa. things you have to carry with you are your wife passport (orignal + copy) and your marraige certificate for proof of relation ship.  you will get the visa in one day.

half-sisters can my half-sister apply a family visit visa for me?
Half Tinker corrections  Half Brother/Sister: where there is One common biological Father/Mother eg: Man having child from first wife marries again and has second child = Half Sibling  Sept Brother/Sister: Where the child is from another parent. eg: Man marries a woman who already has a child from the previous husband
Jentizon - pls chk the links Jentizon - pls chk the links ive given. They will give you a fair idea and also have your sister check with her PRO guy. Since you are now MARRIED you may be able to get only a tourist visa but do check with the PRO just in case.
If the last names are the If the last names are the same then there's no issues in applying for family visit visa. Immigration does not have DNA testing for issuing visa.
Puzzled John and Jane have a kid named Janice  John and Jane get divorced, Jane marries Steve who already has a daughter named Shannon from his ex wife   Steve and Jane have a kid named Justin  What is the connection between Janice, Shannon and Justin?  ;-)
@ smoke justin is the half brother of shannon and janice but shanon and janice are not related, not sharing any parent in common.
wat about half sister ? :(  wat about her second half ?
I always wonder!!! Are such comments out of not understanding the question or out of showing off the languistic skills?  Half sister would be a sister from another father/mother or sister-in-law.  Jentizon, As far as I know this would be dificult and most probably she will need to come on tourism visa; but better to wait for more experienced answer or why not giving it a try.
and hislam stop wondering !  and help the chap buddy !
BTW - Half Sister means Step BTW - Half Sister means Step Sister....  Ok as to the question i dont think it will be possible cuz if my knowledge serves me right you both have to have the same last name or family name to be able to get it but i think you can get a tourist visa  check the following links for more info  http://www.moi.gov.qa/site/english/departments/PassportDept/sections/sec748/748.html  http://portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/services

RE: Vaccination for swine flu SWINE FLUE WIRUS WILL NOT SURVIVE IN QATAR WEATHER . THIS VIRUS IS SPREADING IN HUMID & LOW TEMPERATURE WEATHER .
RE: Vaccination for swine flu Just practice good hygiene (wash hand frequently, etc) and get proper rest.  Chances of getting killed by Landruisers here in Qatar are much higher than Swine Flu.
RE: Vaccination for swine flu The chances that the Swine Flu virus spreads in Qatar are pretty low.  That doesn't mean that you can be careless.  There is not a vaccination to that particular flu yet, according to what I've read in the news (and I'm quite into reading news about swine flu, since I'm from Mexico and have all my family and friends there) is that the vaccination for Swine Flu will be ready from 4 to 6 months time.  Just take care, try to keep you and your baby away from people who had been in affected areas in the last 3 weeks and that should do it. Don't panic!
RE: Vaccination for swine flu Tamiflu ( cipla )........its not exactly a vacination for swine flu they say it works to some extent.
Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? One of my friend was coming to Qatar for the first time on a work visa. He bought 2 bottles of liqour from Bahrain duty free shop. But when he reached Doha airport it was taken away by the customs people. Is it illegal to bring it from duty free??? And also I want to know, whether there will be some problem for him to get his RP? Pls. your views..........
RE: Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? not even god himself can bring it in.
RE: Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? Yes this is Qatar one of the most conservative Gulf countries. You can only get alcohol for private consumption from the QDC. I am sure that they would not have made a note of your friend's name...hopefully not.
RE: Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? Bringing liquor into Qatar is illegal.  The only way to get liquor in Qatar is with the QDC license/permit.  Problems to get the RP?? maybe not...let's see and wait.  Regards!!
RE: Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? Friend, its a SIN here...I hope he shdn't face ne pblm for his RP...
RE: Is it illegal to bring liqour to Qatar? There will not be any problem for your RP, you are bringing it becasue of your non-awareness and they know it, only they will take and distroy it (HOW SAD)

Then buy the stuff & come home & start boozzzzzzzzzzzzzzing

Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? I am thinking of studying there, but.. hesitated a bit; so.. is it safe??
RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? In the daytime yes.... But be aware that at night the Amish roam.... with pitchforks and horse drawn buggies!!!!  Seriously PA is kinda big. You need to be more specific...
RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? yes its very safe  if you do not get around bad people, then u can spend the rest of ur life in the US without any problem.
RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? It can be as safe or dangerous as you want it to be. Having spent 20 + years in the USA, I would say it is safe. Like someone else said, PA is large, where are you going to study? It is a beautiful state, with gorgeous rural areas, bustling city, and lots to do. Outdoor activities are great; it is a hop-skip-and-jump to the New Jersey shore, New York City, and not far to get to Montreal in Canada. I would say if you have the opportunity, you may as well do it.
RE: Is studying in Pensylvannia safe?? Where in Pennsylvania, hon? Philadelphia can be sketchy as can downtown Pittsburgh, but all other places are safe. Which school are you thinking of going to?

RE: need answer please Smoking is not an Issue when it comes to Medical... Just sit back & wait for your Visa...

RE: How can I live in DOHA for long time? Just live without family .. thats the best option to live :)

Notarization of Documents from Philippines? Hello Fellas, may I ask anyone where can my documents be notarized here in Qatar, my papers/documents are all from Philippines, I am applying for NCLEX-RN (US Licensure for Nurses in the US).. I think it can be notarized here because this is my current residency. Help anyone?who knows an attorney who can notarize my documents.  Thanks and Godbless.
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? why you dont ask our embassy... but be patient there.... goodluck!
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? Try ur luck in our embassy maybe its more difficult processing for notarization other than to have an exam in US..lol") best of luck
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? i believe what you need is the authentication of your documents.  The documents you needed to be authenticated should have the red ribbon from DFA Manila. if not then the embassy here will ask you to send it to DFA Manila first before they will authenticate it.  You can do it at the Philippine embassy and then after you go to Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? hi rey...,  bring all your documents to your embassy here in Qatar... they can notarize it... but you have to pay it of course.. i think this cost around hundred riyals per document...
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? by the way rey,  if you mean "Authentication" or "Rid Ribbon", you must first send back your documents to your country -Philippines and ask your relatives to stand as your representative to process the authentication in DFA Manila...  there is a reminder flashes in TFC from Phil. Embassy Doha that any documents you want them stamp it or authenticate it..you must first get authenticated it from the philippines (DFA Manila)...  good luck...
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? Notarization of the documents can be done at the DOHA Philippine Embassy. But for the Authentication.Make sure that all your docs had been authenticated?red ribbon at the DFA Manila else Doha PE won't have it authenticated.
RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? Hi all po. Relative to the topic, may I as what are the various documents that needs to be "authenticated" or "red ribbon" in DFA Manila?  If, for example, I am to work in Qatar, all documents asked by my employer should be bear the red ribbon? (i.e. PRC Certificate, NBi, etc.) Tama po ba? Thanks so much.

Certificate Attestation in Doha. Dear friends,  How to do a certificate attestation in Qatar. My wife got a job in Qatar and now she is asked to attest the certificates from Embassy or ministry of external affairs. Please advise me how to do it.   thanks in advance....
RE: Certificate Attestation in Doha. Go to your respective country's MOFA or Embassy in Qatar. You always need to ratify your documents from ministry of foreign affairs of your country or embassy in foreign country.....
RE: Certificate Attestation in Doha. If this is to do with her Labour Card then welcome to Labour Card Nightmare!.  I am assuming you are Indian. In this case all her academic certificates (not diplomas from pvt institutions) must be sent to India for attestation from the Foreign Affairs Ministry there. Once it is back attest at Indian Embassy. Then go to MOFA and attest all over again.  And all this should be done on the ORIGINAL Certifiacte and NOT copies.  You can contact Asia Translation or UROGULF and they will charge Qrs. 500 per certificate. You will get it from India in 15 days,.
RE: Certificate Attestation in Doha. You need to get a letter from your employer or a utility bill. Then take to your embassy and ask exactly how you do it. For British, we have to send the certicates to a registered solicitor in the uk who stamps them, sends to uk Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then onto Qatar Embassy in London who stamps them. Once back they can be presented to CEID.
Dubai driving license I am holding a Dubai driving license, please advise on the steps to attain a Qatar driving license based on my current Dubai license.
RE: Dubai driving license just you go traffic department and show them your original dubai driving license they will give you new qatar license immediatlly.
RE: Dubai driving license Life could never be so easy; follow abdu's advice above....
RE: Dubai driving license first acquire a letter from your sponsor of no objection then proceed to traffic division for typing then you will have and eye test.. and that's it you will get a qatar license
RE: Dubai driving license Follow the Chiefmate's advice - In addition  ASK the officer to return back your UAE driving licence . In some cases they are not returning . If He does not return you argue with him & take it back . UAE licence is most difficult & they do not transfer same qatar do for other GCC licance - i think
When you retake a driving test...? I took my first driving test this morning and managed to pass the signal, L and parking tests. However, I got screwed in the road test (don't ask).   I'm planning to retake the test sometime this month. By doing so, do you go over the test from the start? Or do you start where you left off (failed)? Like me, for example, I failed the road test, so does that mean I only do the road test?  Thanks!
RE: When you retake a driving test...? You need to appear only from the test you failed and do not have to repeat the passed ones. Try to get a new date; it may take quite a while i.e. around a month. Good Luck
RE: When you retake a driving test...? You will do the failed test... good luck
RE: When you retake a driving test...? u will only take the test which u have failed, those u have passed will not be repeated, has the driving school asked u to take some more learning lessons for the road test, best is u practice with the driving instructor for some more hours, best of luck
RE: When you retake a driving test...? yes u only have to do road test, no need to repeat from start. second thing they failed u sometimes just becoz they r allowed to pass specific quota. they cant pass evryone. they ordered to pass specific number of people. and second everybody is writing that pay some thing to instructor. no need to pay anything to instructor. simply pay 1500 riyal and get rid of test. thats it
Question about Emmigration My friend's father is on Qatar Airways visa (1 month) and he came to qatar on 5th January and he will leave qatar on 6th Feb.morning. and my question is, he is liable to pay any penalty ? Thanks in advance....
RE: Question about Emmigration Hai..   Of cause he has to pay fine for the extra three days, its come QR600/- See you only told that visa is for only 1month, which means only for 30 days. He has entered Qatar on 5th of January 2009, then 30 days completes on midnight of 3rd feb. 2009. Natuarlly he has to pay fine for three days. Better to avoid fine tell your friend to preponed the ticket on 3rd of feb2009. Otherwise his father can enjoy the visit and pay the fine for extra 3 days.  Hope it helps you
RE: Question about Emmigration Surely he will pay, if his visa is on the table. Have a nice day
RE: Question about Emmigration Most probably its a YES. I am not sure.  But you can check at the immigration office near the airport or any immigration office to avoid last minute trouble.
RE: Question about Emmigration YES HE WILL PAY
RE: Question about Emmigration not sure..its no heard from someone...bcoz thy fine only after 24 hours of visa expiry
Can i open a bank account? i am wondering if i can open a bank account as i am on visit visa.

RP? what does RP stand for?
RP stands for "residence RP stands for "residence permit", you must have an RP in form of an ID (also called pataqa) in order to transact business here (even in buying sim card)

yes you can , but will be a yes you can , but will be a deposit account .   but some banks request a letter from the company you are working for to transfer your salary .  in case you are not working , some banks accept and some not .
Mostly NO. You can check the Mostly NO. You can check the bank directly.

where could i buy cute puppies?? i'd like to buy puppies for a pet. but i do not know where to get one..if anyone does, please tell me the shop, place or the address..thanx.
RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? hi there.  i have two small dogs and they are saluki/greyhound type.  they are now 6 months old.   just let me know if you are interested.  no money involve.  its free to good home.  thanks.
RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? All puppies are cute - go to QAWS and if you meet the requirements you will most likely find a companion to love you for life.  However, if you don't meet the requirements - reexamine carefully your desire to get a dog.  They are not a toy, they can live up to 15/16 years of age and they require good care.
RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? pet shop Sure, go ahead to the pet shop at Al Nasr street.  buy a cute puppy.  Just be informed that ALL pet shops in Doha are very unhygenic and have low (if any) standards.  The animals are usually diseased and sick.   My neighbor bought a kitten for christmas at this very shop.  It died the next day.  She had to threaten them with a call to the police in order to get a refund.   QAWS is your best bet as they have trained vets to help them look over the animals in their care.  Go there and get educated about pet ownership.
RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? Did you try to search before posting? I'm sure you'll get lots of replies saying "Try QAWS"!
RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? Ask for Nasr Street. it is before ramada signal. there is a pet shop there with alot of cute pupies.  Good Luck

RE: Marriage Certificate Attestation Make sure don't get attestation from Qatar UROGULF Ajents... they will charge like anything.... get it from ajents in India only.... Go on site www.urogulf.com there u can find ajents at ur place....

Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar I recently was offered a job in Doha..I found here some useful insight about rental rates. What are the other high and costly expenses?I am also wondering about  drinking water!Do people usually drink from tap or bottled water in Qatar?Since tap water got me sick once in my city!!
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar One liter mineral water is 1.50 Riyals and one litter petrol onlu 0.70 dirham (coin) but still water for 25 gallon you will get for 6-50 to 8 riyals.
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar One liter mineral water is 1.50 Riyals and one litter petrol onlu 0.70 dirham (coin) but still water for 25 gallon you will get for 6-50 to 8 riyals. You can use boiled water (from tap) or mineral water your choice.
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar Qatar is indeed one of the fastest developing countries in the world. We are not living a primitive life here. However drinking Fuel is far cheaper than Mineral Water. Jokes apart, You get all kind of Mineral Water in Qatar and that too from all parts of the world. I am sure there is a brand of mineral water of Jordan as well, coz i have seen and bought Lebanese brand as well. The water is really tasty.  Anyway the Tap water is very safe to drink in qatar, as long as you filter it. Water is being treated with best and latest technology here. So you need not worry.  In any case you have great quality mineral water here for you to enjoy and drink ! Cheers
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar Its a nice & cool place to live. Irrespective of what water you prefer to drink,its safe and heatlthy.you can even buy water by paying 7-8riyals per 20liter or can even use tap water. Qatar is a very nice and clean country as its a small unlike our country due to 100 crores of population its very difficult for our governament to stop pollution/corruption/or dieseases spreading due to uncleanlines........something magically needs to happen to change our country's infrastructure. But still i am proud to be an Indian and i love Qatar as well.
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar Bottled water is pretty cheap and lots of places sell large jugs for water coolers. There is very little to do here and there is a caste system between the different races, so luxary items aimed at the favored nationals and food targeted at westerners as well as western housing is expensive. Though most items have cheap alternatives.
RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar Drink petrol. It's cheaper than water.
Movies with the most shocking endings. Ok so I have been bitten by this bug of mystery thriller movies. Which one do you guys think was the movie with the best twist in the plot. I mean really shocking like The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects. That kind of movie. Ofcourse I will appreciate it if you don't give out the endings, lol..
Harry Potter and the Half Harry Potter and the Half Blood prince ..for those who are not an avid follower of the book series and had just stuck watching and relied on the movie series, one would not ever thought that that "person" was the half blood prince... and it was not for real I mean it was only a pseudonym...
Armageddon (sp) a tragic ending indeed!
The original Italian Job .. The original Italian Job .. or The Fight Club ..

Looking for Photography crash course photography is our recreation with my hubby, and we realize it is nice management for stress. Is there any crash course for basic phography that perhaps we can apply in our near future?
RE: Looking for Photography crash course You can try a distance learning course with the newyork institue of photography. I have signed up for this course about a year ago...the website is www.nyip.com. Costs 1000$. They will send you the books,DVD's and CD's and many many other things you will need. you take their tests at the end of the each module and send a photo project and you are assigned your own tutor to criticize your work and you move on according to your own pace.
RE: Looking for Photography crash course i also would like to join the course if there is any...

HSBC  loan interest . Recently I heard that QCB has instructed to reduce the loan interest to 6 % for the new and existing loan holders. Any update on this I am HSBC customer and still they deduct same amount... Any info from when this will effect and it is mandatory to all the Banks ( As i heard from my friend QNB already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period has reduce) What a relief if this true????
RE: HSBC  loan interest . It's a new law. But you know how laws are treated in this country. Don't you?
RE: HSBC  loan interest . I am surprised that you are so INNOCENT The banks here increase the interest even befor it can be really approved , but when the central bank already decleared reduction of interest  officialy , these banks still wait and kill time till they implement as they want to SQUIZE the customers. The rule of the gane is simple: HEADS I WIN  & TAILS  YOU LOOSE and all this is called fair practice-hahahahahaha GOD BLESS
RE: HSBC  loan interest . How about asking your bank?
RE: HSBC  loan interest . hi all!! yes the HSBC does not yet adjusted accordingly as of now. i heard from a friend that they will adjust this by this month. so nothing to worry about. I am an HSBC account holder for for the last 8 years now, and as i know the directive of QCB should be followed by all banks as it was mentioned clearly on the newspapers.
RE: HSBC  loan interest . Thanks... Hope as per QBC directive they will reduce the interest . Will wait for the next month and see. Yes They have increase the rate earlier must be knowing new directive is coming and they want to squeezes us some way to get some extra.

The reason I mentioned the The reason I mentioned the 5% was because there were signs posted all around town (last I saw one was about a month ago) advertising 5% interest on savings accounts.  I believe it was QNB, but I'm not sure.  Yes, I've heard similar bad things about HSBC.  Looks like I'll be looking into QNB and Commercial Bank then.  One of my most important requirements is seamless online access and transfers.

Still 3 days delay.   /Don't have time yet but when I get back to Doha, I'm gonna look into changing banks.   //By the way, HSBC still owes me the cash that didn't get dispensed from the ATM machine a few weeks ago despite being deducted from my account!!! @#!!  ***************************************** Don't want no drama, No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you in a hotel initially, or straight in housing.  I will be traveling with one child.  I have read that 2 bedrooms comes with one king bed and a medium bed in the other room?  Is the medium bed a queen bed or full size bed?  I would like to know so I know what size sheets to purchase.
RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... if your company will provide you housing, usually, if the housing is not yet ready for occupancy, they will get a hotel accomodation for you and your family. if it's ready, then you'll be going to your house straight from the airport. like me, the housing was ready so the company driver delivered me staright there, unlike my colleague he was stayed at the hotel until the housing's ready.
RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... the medium size bed is as size as the double size bed
RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... If your housing is not ready, you may be taken to a hotel or a serviced apartment, or guest house/ accommodations. These will be fully furnished.  If its a two bedroom apartment, it's not necessary that the second room will have a medium size bed, it may have 2 single beds, and that can be 90x180 or 120x180 cm.  Don't get the sheets for the guest bedroom yet. You may get one king size bed sheet for the master bedroom.
RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... Thank you all, so I will just bring King sheets for now.  Is it fairly accessible to get a variety of linen over there?  The higher thread counts?  Or warmer sheets for the cooler nights?  Also blankets? I was told to bring a blanket, could I obtain that over there?

resign? hi good morning...Qlers..  i am an employee of a private engineering firm.. been working for six months..hired here at doha (local hire).. sponsorship transferred to the company.. work duration 1 year renewable..  the question is..  i want to resign from my work..what are he possibilities..will they allow? or will they send me home? please i need your advice.. thanks
RE: resign? 1- Nothing in the Qatari law forces the current employer to give you a N.O.C. - release you - or transfer your visa to another employer, it depends on your current employer mode.  2- you should continue one year - 365 - of work for the current employer in order to be eligible for visa transfer even if he permits you to transfer your visa.
RE: resign? Yes u can resign, but as soon as u resign u will get 2 years ban on your re entry, for that you speak to your employer and try to get release or NOC from the sponsorer.
RE: resign? generaly in the reputed companies if you are hired locally they don't mind giving NOC which is your right. anyway don't resign before confirming with your sponser
RE: resign? We can only advise you to talk patiently and calmly with your EMPLOYER/BOSS to provide NOC to u..  Yes, you can resign but don't expect for the leniency of your BOSS always.. All the best..<img src="http://www.pic4ever.com/images/shake2.gif" border="0" >
RE: resign? Company will allow you if you are really desperate to go but you have to follow the conditions stipulated in your employment contract.
RE: resign? unfortunately, it is entirely up to your sponsor if he wants to give you an NOC .. most companies allow sponsorship transfer if you stay with them minimum of 2 years. (small number of companies do this, discreetly.) as you well know... no NOC means 2 years ban.. :(

RE: Where can I get my Computer Hard Disk Recover?(acer... As an experienced professional computer user you probably have a complete backup of your data on an external USB hard drive. Maybe you even made a disk image of the c drive or an ASR disk. So, you can throw the defect harddisk away and enjoy your wise planning. If not, well, then you deserve exactly what you got.

what do you miss? what would you load up on? Hi,  Getting ready for the move over and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on things you really can not get in Doha that 'at home' is just readily available. Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons.  Anything esle?
Olive and olive oil Bring real extra virgin olive oil . Olive oils in markets have no smell , no taste and I have serious concerns that most olive oils in here are mixed ( olive oil + sunflower oil etc , especially spanish brands)
Over-the-counter meds can be Over-the-counter meds can be difficult to find. I bring naproxyn and ibuprofin as well as benedryl (diphenhydramine.) Mandi
Expat, now you have an Expat, now you have an excuse to buy lots of lovely Oriental carpets :-)
Tim tams!!! If you know Tim tams!!! If you know vegimite then you'd know tim tams! I miss the tim tam coffee straw experience  p.s...if you do manage to bring some, pm me and I'll bring the coffee :)
The tampon shortage is long The tampon shortage is long gone lol. I would advise bringing medicines thought, even though they are available here under different names I feel more comfy with my trusted brands (placebo effect I guess). If you use any specific hair care products I bring mine from home as many salon and drug store brands are not available here (Paul Mitchell, Goldwell, Joico, Aussi).   Many UK food items are here in Shoprite and Mega Mart, and if they dont have it you can ask them and they will sometimes bring it in.  "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Yep Amoud is right they bring it for you for the 3 or 4 times price..

what to bring Hi, i am not australian, but i have seen Marmite at QMart in The Mall. Not seen Vegemite and my aussie friends say you cannot find here. You can find Colemans mustard at MegaMart. You cannot get Red Wine vinegar or anything with the word "wine" in it! I do not "grocery shop" i forage, as you cannot find everything you need in one place.  But you can find pretty much all you need, it will cost you though! I just moved her from London, and before that Japan, and i though it was expensive there!  It was NOTHING compared to here...bring lots of cash if you want to eat like you do at home!There is a Marks and Spencer in Landmark mall that has nice food once in a while, bisquits and crisps and the like. Family Food on Al Merqab seems to have expat things usually, as well. If you can get a visit here before you move that would be helpful as well! Good luck, and be prepared for lots of changes in your life....
getting ready bring some pork! u can't find it here... LOL   "Ask the Lord to bless your plans and you will be successful in carrying them out." - Proverbs 16:3

Dear Boetie, there are 18 areas in which you can purchase property as a non Qatari.  The best known of which are the areas stated previously, The Pearl and West Bay Lagoon (inc. Zig Zag Towers). Also there is Lusail, a whole new city which is presently being built next to the West Bay area, and where the first apts in 'Foxhills' will be available to move into from mid 2013. These will be made up of low rise apartment buildings built around Italian style Piazzas.   Additionally there are 14 other areas, within central Doha, in which you can purchase residential property or land, however these are mainly in the older and far more built up areas of Doha.  If you require more information on available properties or land, then please take a look at our website:  www.mirageproperty.com  where you will find a good selection of properties available for purchase. If there is anything of interest or you require further info, please feel free to contact us directly, via the 'Enquiry' button on the website. One of my sales consultants will then respond and try to assist in any way they can.  I look forward us being of assistance.  Kind regards  Craig at Mirage

Passport while travelling? Where do you keep your passport during a Holiday Trip? Do you keep it in the Hotel room locker or you carry it with you?   I normally carry it with me in my handbag. Been to Far East few times it was safe with me. But two of my friends recently lost their passports. One in Bangkok from their Hotel room and one in Malaysia from their backpack.   I Just wanted to know what do you all normally do?
i deposit it in my safe i deposit it in my safe locker in the bank - back home !   but when i travel in some other countries, most of the hotels have a safe deposit locker in rooms - so i keep it there.
Not relvent post what it has to do Qatar Living? ;)  I deposit with reception where possible or the safe locker in the room.  Forgot the pass key once for safe locker :(
do not carry it around with do not carry it around with you and do not leave it in a suitcase in your room.  Put it in the hotel room safe . If there is none, put in a safety deposit box that the hotel provides. Make sure YOU put it inside, and you get a form from the hotel that indicates that it is their locker and that your passport is in there. With that, THEY have to take responsibility if something untoward happens and can't blame you.
When traveling, I always When traveling, I always carry a belt bag where I can put my passport and some cash, it is not prone for pickpocketing as the pocket is visibly in front of me and i can rest my hand on top of it as well. ;)
passport while in a holiday trip its better to make a copy of it&keep it with u,original shud be in the safe deposit locker of the place u checked in.this is what i was doing since 1999.never had a problem until 2011.i carried my passport in backpack&it was stolen by an a---le in china&had to see hell. its better to follow what i said
Keep your PP close to your Keep your PP close to your heart and keep a copy of it scanned in your cell phone...
I always prefer and do carry I always prefer and do carry the PP copies along with me, while keeping the original PP at Hotel reception.  Also, it is best practice to store the full documents online, so that it can be retrieved anywhere, at any point of time.
http://QatariTravel.com/ I will deposit it in the safety box or inside my suitcase in the room..  http://qataritravel.com/
Personally keep it! I have traveled to 18 countries across Asia, Middle East and Europe for the past three years and all those times, I just kept my passport with me. I put it in my handbag always and I have never experienced losing it.  I know of some of my colleagues who lost their passport when they have it placed in their handbags. What they did when they lost their passport was report to the police for record of the lost passport, report to their embassy and sought help.  Basically, it depends on the person. If you are the type who always lose anything when traveling, better keep it in the safety deposit box in your hotel but if you know you can take care of it even when you move from one place to another, then, keep it with you.
I keep it in the hotel room I keep it in the hotel room or just keep it in my pocket while going outside.. Never really thought too much about it.
Usually in the Hotel Room, Usually in the Hotel Room, but haven't had a Bad Experience when Visiting Malaysia, or Thailand & even Phils...
loolz Get a pp copy and visa copy, and keep the orgnal pp at the hotel,
been here for 2weeks, been here for 2weeks, passport still with me,  on a business visa though.
Put it in my purse wherever i Put it in my purse wherever i go...
Passports Give to admin.....
I will Thank you all...:)  I will deposit it in the reception or inside my suitcase in the room.. dont want to carrying it with me....:) I been doing that before and nothing happened...but dont want to take a chance..:)
In my opinion, it's not In my opinion, it's not advisable to carry your importance documents unnecessarily all the time, keep it with your other belongings under key and lock at a safe place.
Its always the best practice Its always the best practice to hand it over at the Hotel Reception while you check-in & get it back on Check-out ! Carrying passport along is even more risky that leaving it in a safe locker in your room!   I got my Laptop bag stolen in Barcelona this time & had much of my important docs in it, luckily my passports were in the Hotel Reception.. !   Ofcourse, once you loose passport, its a nightmare!
I remember a time when we I remember a time when we don't have a safety box yet back home, I forgot where I put the passports and it was the day before our flight back to Doha, I was so worried and dead sweating when suddenly my baby opened his school bag and took our passports out (my baby took it from the cabinet and put in his bag). Whew! What a relief!
its best to carry with yrself its best to carry with yrself rather than to keep it in hotel room or locker
Yes BM.. losing your passport Yes BM.. losing your passport is a nightmare..my friend had to go back to India and wait for three weeks to get his new Passport and visa done to come back here. Thats why I am worried.  As Khanan said..I was also thinking of depositing it at the Hotel reception.   Even if they pickpocket our money, cards ...we can somehow get back here...but without passport we will be stranded there.
Wife purse is the safest Wife purse is the safest place, as the makeup in purse will be more valuable than the passport she will never let it go !
It will be more comfortable It will be more comfortable to keep it with you but is safer to keep in the locker.
BG Not all wives i think. As I personally do not carry one and neither loves putting on make up. :P  But yes, maybe to some. :)  If i have our passports in my purse, i usually put it in the middle zipped portion.
Umm I keep it in the room locker or locked up in my suitcase. But when I go to some countries, I keep a scanned copy of my passport with me at all times :-)

Assha Lebanese restaurant - Expensive? Hi Guys,  Please, advise if this restaurant is expensive to dine in? We are 7 persons, how much u think it would cost me?  thanks!
assaha - stay away from assaha - stay away from Lebanese hype....
How about AL-Layali restauran How about AL-Layali restauran along salwa road (Near Jarir) anyone have an advise to this? I Really appreciate the feedback guys.. BTW this dinner is for my boss! T_T he is giving me  hardtime to please him.
Almost everything you see on Almost everything you see on the Leb menu has its ancestors going back to Greece and most of their cuisine is a mock up of Greek cuisine. So personally rather safe myself the hassle and just go to a  real Greek Restaurant.
Assaha Restaurant I had dinner there a couple of years back, and as a Lebanese i was not very satisfied with the food. The "ambiance" is nice but that's it. Moreover, it is expensive for what u're eating! Al Khreiss in Souq Wakif is much better and prices are more accessible to all. Le Gourmet also is not bad.  I heard that Damaska is not bad (also in Souq). You also have Al Mourjan Restaurant on the Corniche. We were there last friday and they have a minimum fee of 150 QRS per person. But the food is excellent. Until now, this restaurant is the closest to Lebanese food possible. As for the seafood restaurant in Katara, i heard it's very tasty but i think it's expensive. Also there's the Bourj Al Hamam in  the Pearl which should be way too expensive. Bon Appetit :)
you should try golden fish in you should try golden fish in al sad. It really is worth the avg 100 riyal per person to have great sea food.
layali, hte near qatar layali, hte near qatar decoration? you will have to bear shisha smell there
iM SORRY, ITS Assaha iM SORRY, ITS Assaha
gr8 place we recently dined for 7 - 8 ppl, with fresh sea food comprising of Hamour Fish and Giant Shrimps, with arabic salad and mixed kebabs and soups .. we paid around 1800 QAR , within 2000QAR
It all really depends on your It all really depends on your appetite... but to put an average number on it, I would say about 150 - 200 QR per person
O.o OMG! 1800-2000! O.o OMG! 1800-2000! thanks!  It' Lebanese resto located at Grand Hamad Street.  Any other suggestions for a good restaurant thats not ridiculously expensive? ^__^
It's expensive.. Yes. It's an expensive one... But we didn't like their taste... We found Majlis much better... Yeah but if you want to enjoy Lebanese village kind of atmosphere, it's worth it...  How much is it expensive? It depends upon your order and servings.. U may get QR 1000 bill for 7 persons...
Majlis or Khayal I would suggest   Majlis opposite to Marks n Spencer (Land Mark) and Al Sadd   Khayal: Giant Store's Food Court... Well, it's menu is not that big one but I always found its taste way better than any luxury restaurant... Especially Hummus and Shawarma... There is another Khayal or TV R/A.. Don't go to that one.
Try "Khariss" at the old souk Try "Khariss" at the old souk (souk waqif), great food and the prices are better than alsaha's
How about this Seafood How about this Seafood restaurant in Katara? what you called that again? any advise on this one? I saw a lots of people dine there...

Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing accommodation? Hello! We will be soon relocated to Doha.  In sight of the living costs (rent, etc.) a friend and I have decided to share a flat or villa whilst in Doha. Can you guys please tell us if this can be done? if it's okay in Doha? if you have heard of other people doing the same? Your input is appreciated.  Regards,
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... Technically it is not advised..However it does happen here, all depends where the accomodation is and who are your neighbours..In a compound it is easier..
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... a big NO-NO!!! unless of course, if you're asking for trouble,...it's a very risky thing to do here, you never know who just might blow the whistle on you...
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... U will be sued...
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... How will you explain this to your landlord?
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... As always. If you both act on a low profile the neighbors..will not complain, just state to your neighbors that you are married,, they will not know the wiser,. But as stated it is illegal, friends of mine where caught, they were put in by their neighbors. Some people have great satisfaction in reporting you to the police. As some say they pay spotters to find incidents like this, it is the fastest way to get promoted in the ranks.. It also depends on your race as well Just keep a low profile and get an apartment in a compound with a lot of westerners.  But is it worth loosing your job and going to jail over.. i think not
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... hmmm this sounds not good my friend.. its not allowed here.. if the CID will know. you will get in trouble...
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... This is a conservative country & you ought to respect the culture & the rule of the law just as you expect anybody to respect the laws of your country.
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... for some coins u want to do an illigel work. why?  Respect law and order of  the country
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... All. Just wanted to apologize if the question I made was unproper or that may show misrespect. Again, the only way to get involve without doing wrong is to ask and to receive feedback. To those of you that replied on stating that we will breaking the laws and code of conduct in the city, rest assured that this situation is absolutely new for us, as new is our relocation to the Middle East. Thanks to all for the feedback, it will allow me to better understand the country and it's culture, as well to aware some other colleagues. Any other details/advices are more than welcome.  Au revoir!
RE: Man and Woman not married (friends) sharing... save money & save trouble .ask for a male to stay/share with you,later on when you are here and know the country /your situation/law/culture well if you still dare to take a chance go ahead. Dont worry you are Welcome its a friendly country except some rules not to be borken atleast while  others watching.

Where, as in a good website for jobs, you can check www.bayt.com, make an account, upload your C.V and the necessary information and then look for a job there, based on either the company or the position you want.   Good luck!

Honda Civic would be more Honda Civic would be more fuel efficent. for common sense 1800cc engine would consume less fuel than 2400cc.
Honda civic is better Honda civic is better
most of the engine now a days most of the engine now a days are fuel efficient with the new engineering and technology, but that would depend on power or let's say SUV's and 4 x 4 are having powerful engines who will need more fuel everytime you step on accelerator.

I want to stop smoking I really want to stop smoking. I have tried almost everything except hypnotherapy. Does anyone know any good hypnotherapist here in Qatar? Thank you all.
RE: I want to stop smoking my friends saying quieting cigar is very easy bcoz they did it hundred of times
RE: I want to stop smoking Its very easy i smoked for 20 years continues just decided and now its 10 years i never smoke. Its only decesion, i do not agree to the people who say its body requirment its only habbit. First two weeks are only difficult. My friend just decide and thats all.
RE: I want to stop smoking before you stop smoking, i think the best you can do is to STOP BUYING CIGARETTES.
RE: I want to stop smoking Best way to get rid of smoking habbit is gradually decrease the number. think of times when you just smoke for the heck of it, such as with cup of tea, as soon as you sit in the car etc and then avoid lighting up one at such times. chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor. Dont deprive yourself by just deciding to quit, it will not work. all the best
Shipping from Australia? Hi,   I am moving over in January from Oz and I am thinking about shipping a box over to Doha, from what I can find on the net it seems to be fairly pricey, just wondering if anyone has any tips on who I should use? Or if it is just easier to use excess baggage?  thanks.
It can actually be cheaper It can actually be cheaper to go excess baggage - if you're travelling via Emirates you will be allowed 2 x 30Kg bags anyways - Qatar Air has a very miserly baggage allowance.  Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"
better buy here than bring better buy here than bring with pay.  Too late, if you move early i might be able to help as my family members are coming from Sydney and they have only 50 Kgs to bring out of 92 Kgs
if its something you if its something you absolutely cannot live without, use unaccompanied luggage, its cheaper than excess luggage.
thank you for all the thank you for all the advice, looks like its culling and excess baggage.  Bluemountain I would take you up on that offer, but i am currently in melbourne :)  thanks again.
Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? i am an indian having Qatar Residence permit (currently in India)with A profession of "Administrative". let me know is this profession eligible to get Dubai On Arrival Visa?? expecting reply....
RE: Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? there is no position such as "Administrative".. it should be either Administrative Assistant of Administrator.
RE: Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? The profession you mentioned is not listed so it will be better to check with the Airlines first. They will not let you board if the profession is not eligible to get the visa on arrival.   There is no credit card payment at Dubai Airport. You should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charges and that is the only one the Immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currencies according their exchange rates.
RE: Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? DXB Immigration only accept cash payments at the two exchange counters at the back of the hall. I was there earlier this week and had to join the queue to pay for my eGate card :o(  It would probably be wiser to send your mandoob with your passport to the UAE embassy and get the visa before you travel.
RE: Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? <code><b>Yes you would get a visa on arrival...But dont forget, they dont accept cash...so always keep a credit card with you for paying the visa fee :-)</code></b>
Is 16K a good salary?? Hi,my husband has been offered a job in Qatar with a salary of 16000. we have a 3 year old child. I would like to know whether 16000 is good enough a package considering its all inclusive which means we will have to rent a 2 bedroom apartment, get a car, etc. We would like to put our child in a good Indian curriculum school. Please help me out.
First- Not very advisable to First- Not very advisable to put up the name of the company with your real name. Edit that part out. Second- As for the salary, it's good enough, not great but not bad either.. Families are living on 8,000 QAR as well and I meet some families moaning about only 50,000 that they get.  If he is in sales, he should get a car from the company so I guess you can cross out that from your expenditure. Every sales guy in here gets one.
wk is right 16k is good enough a salary to survive here in Qatar. If you husband can still speak to his company and get an accommodation, then it will be like an icing on the cake.   also, if he is in sales im sure he should get a car as well as incentives, fuloos yaani :)
Nice furnished apartments -2 Nice furnished apartments -2 bedroom costs like only 5k+car EMI maximum 2K and schooling in good school maximum 2K so its gonna be OK with this salray.You will have a decent life..
A good 2BHK would cost you A good 2BHK would cost you somewhere around QR 6000-8000(furnished/semi furnished)..And that too depends on the locality... There are few good INDIAN SCHOOLS in DOHA..seeing your baby's age, better drop her at KINDERGARTEN first which are of in abundance in DOHA...

Which is the best in Laptops? I want to buy a laptop (Core 2 dou). Can u advise me which make I must choose.? Dell, Sony, HP....?
RE: Which is the best in Laptops? well u have Sony on ur list, i vote for that.. why Core 2 Duo? that is so long ago???
RE: Which is the best in Laptops? I have bought a DELL Studio XPS just before moving to Qatar , but returned it right away. If you're a picky user, you will be dissapointed with the amount of heat it can generate. XPS is basically a gaming machine. Then I have bought a toshiba and very very unhappy with it, sometime it just stops working. From my previous experience, IBM T series laptops are the best one, then Dell Lattitude series.Never buy Dell inspiron series, my wife got one - very cheap made laptop. Finally if you have the budget go with the Macbook Pro - it generates less heat, battery life is also good and runs on BSD Unix on the background. You can also visit CNet or Amazon.com to see some of the reviews before even choosing one.  Cheers
RE: Which is the best in Laptops? all of them have some or the other problems... if you can add a bit to ur amount, go for MAC,, its amazing.!!
