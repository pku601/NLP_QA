Q1_C2	RE: Massage oil Dear, All! Please read question before you are writing answer! i wasn`t asking where I can do massage!!! I asked about oil!  As for second answer - I`m searching oil for body massage. Bought one in Canterpoint, there is a small shop near sports shop, and that oil has nice smell, but! It`s not for making massage to anyone!
Q1_C3	RE: Massage oil Again...I`m happy for you that you have oil?! Did you read my question?! I have a lots of things, but I`m not writing here about it!!! Don`t be stupid, people, read before you write something!!! I have question, need answer directly to this question, not your empty answers about nothing!
Q1_C4	RE: Massage oil You might be able to find Body Massage Oil in Body Shop at Landmark or City Centre, and if they do have it there, its guaranteed to be good for massage, as some places sell duplicates, so watch out as this could cause allergies to the skin. Good Luck !

Q5	how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit visa there? How can my boyfriend who currently works for a government office there get me and our baby a visit visa? How long can we stay there in doha and can we also get married there as well? Can we stay together in his house there? Can you give us advice and the steps to take for getting visa and requirements for marriage there in Qatar? It will be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance
Q5_C1	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... Boyfriend cant. But as a husband he can apply for visit visa for both of you.
Q5_C2	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... Yep Boyfriend cannot sponsor you but if he becomes your husband then he can..
Q5_C3	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... As far as i know you need to show a proof as a marriage certificate when applying as you have to show your proof of relationship.
Q5_C4	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... your nationality plays a major role here. coz there r certain citizenships who can get on arrival visas just from the airport on arrival. if u r from one of those countries, u don't have any problem. just buy the tickets, come down here, get the visa from the airport on arrival BUT YOUR CITIZENSHIP......!!!!!
Q5_C5	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... we want to get married there in Qatar once we arrive there..its this possible?  I was told that he can apply for visit visa for me and our son.. He wants us to get married in Qatar
Q5_C6	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... Dear,  Why dont you let your boy friend arrange the things for you if he really wants to marry you here. The process would be long and lots of documentations needed.  I have a friend who got married here (no child) lots of documentation needed and takes long time to get their marriage certificate issued and therefore she had to fly back to her home country waiting for the attestation of the marriage certificate.  Once it is done, then waiting for family visa to be processed.  So get yourself ready for all the process. Good luck for your wedding.
Q5_C7	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... thanks for your answers but I really would like some help on this. We want to get married in Qatar. The fact that we are getting married there is it not proof enough for Qatari officials to know that we will be legal and enough requirement for us to stay with my fiance in his house? We were supposed to get married here in the Philippines but he didn't have time for us to set the wedding here..Thanks again!
Q5_C8	RE: how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit... much easier to get a civil married first then apply for the visa,this way you can stay with him legally with no worries at all
Q6	Is it cheaper to buy new clothes in Qatar than pay to transport them over from the UK? I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over. Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?
Q6_C1	RE: Is it cheaper to buy new clothes in Qatar than pay to... since u specifically about NEXT then the prices r the same...except that here u dont get EVERYTHING u find over in the UK but we do have most of the British stores.We have Debanhams,M&S,BHS and Next.But over all 1000 is way to much to pay....depending on how much clothes you have .....or need...i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the prices, u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind... Good luck
Q6_C2	RE: Is it cheaper to buy new clothes in Qatar than pay to... I'm kinda particular about and partial to my clothing so I brought mine. The choices here are not infinite and there isn't the catelog shopping available either.
Q6_C3	RE: Is it cheaper to buy new clothes in Qatar than pay to... If you already have clothes then it's infinitely cheaper to bring them than to buy more!
Q6_C4	RE: Is it cheaper to buy new clothes in Qatar than pay to... I would just want to reiterate that prices are MUCH higher here. For example yesterday in M&S looked at a pair of trousers, UK price 29.50, Qatar price 200QR, which means about 38 sterling at the current rates. Next I have found to be even worse than this. At another shop bought my son some Clarks sandles costing 245QR which would have been 30 in the UK. Talk about mark up ! I would also say that the range of clothing to the average UK taste is quite limited. As soon as you go outside of the UK shops you can run into some rather ornate clothing. The quality can be questionable aswell. Not sure how the higher end international shops compare. I am currently counting down the days til I go back to the UK in the summer and hit the summer sales ! Planning on going with empty cases and coming back with rather full ones LOL.

Q8_C3	RE: anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars... it might take awhile to sell a dodge car nowadays and if you are looking for a best sell place i don't suggest you to park your car in one of those car shops at salwa roads, it take awhile to be noticed, so  your best bet to find car showrooms inside doha or add your car at http://qatarsale.com by contacting them and they will do the rest
Q8_C4	RE: anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars... try these sites, www dot qatarsale dot com and www dot qatarcl dot com...good luck

Q9	my doubt I would like to know some information from you all . Suppose someone came here under visit visa and extended it up to six month. Then after six month he went, my doubt is that, how many moths should he wait to come here again after. Can he come here again within one month under a new visit visa?
Q9_C1	twinkle twinkle little star come on all just clear out my doubt
Q9_C2	the person should have been under family sponsorship. thats the only visa i think which is extensible upto 6 months. Anyways, the person has to wait 3 months to come back.
Q9_C3	After Three Months. After Three Months.
Q9_C4	Living up to the reputation Bond and others have given me Moths will not help you being here at all.  They are fluttery creatures that destroy cloth. I doubt any moth will help you at all.  To be puerile though and living up to the persona some have created for me on QL. I will say this, can't answer your question as I don't have a problem with travel as I am English and as much as we are 'hated' by some we can travel anywhere we like.
Q10	is there any temple in qatar ...... Hi, as most indians live in qatar.... is there any temple in qatar.....
Q10_C1	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/living-in-qatar/any-hindu-temple  write temple on the search at  the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic..............
Q10_C2	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... Qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more. So u may see churches here but you wont find temples. And idol worship is not allowed in islam. Hence you wont find temples here. I hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves.
Q10_C3	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... Shayampsundar....... You are prejudiced against Qatar............ why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed..... as you claim!! Asians are slave??????????? Are you treating yourself as a leader of again community here.  Beware such statements can lead to your deportation also....... i know you are still a kid ( based on your profile)...... but refrain from unworthy comments...... otherwise this would lead to problem for your parents who are earning their livelihood here and feeding you!!!
Q10_C4	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... SHYAM SUNDER....  are they treating u as a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave....coz i do not think that any one here has bothered to chain ur legs to some shackles here and kept u bonded...u are here just for your some meaningful gains and u are making yourself a slave to the country..like any respect a human being deserves everyone has the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he likes or dislikes...so if u do not like the systems here y the hell are u making urself a slave or a DOG over here...get lost man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others as slaves..so cheers
Q10_C5	RE: is there any temple in qatar ...... shayampsundar, u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect Qatar or the relegion Islam!by giving comments to ur brother..... if somebody treated u as slave don't generalized all the locals or Qatari/we all know most indians was lazy and trying hard/they think that they know everything but we know that their really something/talkative and staburn...

The franchise owner would be happy to know about your idea but I believe there are some business issues to hurdle first when franchising in foreign countries.

Q22_C11	waaaaaaaaaaa!! i Already checked the kababayan supermarket. but they dont have globe roaming sim there. only smart. i'm using smart now just for temporary. Smart cannot be called but i'm not sure of it. My gf is globe and its too expensive for her to text to my smart because it will cost her 2php every text. Everytime my gf call me it cost her.. 20php per 1min. uhmm.. Maybe I'll try to find globe sim in souq. I hope i could get one there. Globe has a good signal here too. When i arrived here im using globe roaming sim. and its ok but it was been deactivated last thursday because my load dind'nt catch up. ehehe!Thank you!! ill try to check the stores again there or if i cant really find one here.. maybe i'll just ask my friends in phil who are going here in qatar.  Thanks again! btw are you all filipino? ^_^
Q22_C12	i didnt see any globe sim in i didnt see any globe sim in filipino souq... there are lots of smart sim available in souq..
Q22_C13	simangot, i suggest your GF simangot, i suggest your GF switch to smart sim in pinas. I will tell you some encouragement and ideas. And advantages and disadvantages of both Globe and Smart. Here it goes:  With SMART, you dont have to load everyday or every week just to maintain your sim or be activated. you can do SmartLoad or Over The Air Reload once in 3 Months. The sim will be deactivated within 120 days of NO LOAD. 1 Peso text from Pinas to Internatioal Roaming Sim. Smart Signal is also good in Doha. In industrial Area is good, why not in the city. :)  With GLOBE, you have to maintain a LOAD everytime for the rest of your life in abroad. Much Expensive.  With Smart, when activated as Roaming Sim, Pure Text only. While Globe, you can receive/make calls but it's expensive. International Rate Charges Apply. If you happen to buy that Globe OFW Sim, it's a BULL! They said on the TV Commercials that no maintaining balance for 1 year or Forever, i dont remember anymore. It's not True! you still have to reload within 1 month of use.  I guess you are working here in Doha, right? I bet you talk to your GF at night or after work or in the morning. Why don't you buy QTEL Sim from QTEL Offices. It's only 50QR now, i think they still have this Promo going on. Or better yet, there is this internet calls located in Doha. Maybe its in Souq or Industrial Area. 1 minute is to 1QR. Cheaper than using your QTEL SIm to call Pinas for 1.85QR per minute.
Q22_C14	GLOBE FAMILY SIM PACK comes GLOBE FAMILY SIM PACK comes with 1PC OFW PREACTIVATED ROAMING SIM and 2PCS FAMILY SIM sold at PHP120.00 only available at designated retail outlets in the Philippines. u would easily find it while processing some of ur papers at POEA Ortigas.  Family Sim can text and call the OFW Sim at a cost of philippine local standard SMS and Calling charges. The OFW sim remains still active even at a zero load balance while abroad provided, however, any of the family sim must use the facility of SMS or calling at a time not exceeding within a month period. Anyhow, anyone of the Family Sim dont have any SMS or calling activity within a month to an OFW SIM, the service shall be automatically deactivated. Likewise, the OFW sim lost its special service capabilities. The OFW SIM will be then regarded as ordinary SIM.  >
Q22_C15	why stick to Globe? A lots why stick to Globe? A lots of Smart Roaming SIM is available in Souq Area. Electronic loading is also available there.   EOF0825

The teaching however is terrible. So if you really want to learn driving, go to some other place. If you just want the licence, you can try gulf driving school

Q26	General tier 1 migrant visa to UK Hi ladies and gentlemen, i would like to know if any one has experience applying for UK visa General Tier 1 that allows u to work in UK. please ur advise is v important.
Q26_C1	I happen to know first I happen to know first hand..factors such as age, education and earnings for the past 12 mths of the applicant will be alloted 'points' and if he/she meets the minimum points for this visa category then its not a problem at all. You will have to apply from outside the UK for this, even if you are currently residing there under a different visa category.  What do you want to know specifically?   ~Live like there's no tommorrow~
Q26_C2	Thanks for your reply Pin, Thanks for your reply Pin, have u applied before for this type of visa? i would like to know how easy i can be accepted and how long it takes to know if i will be granted this visa.. please advise
Q26_C3	yes, i have been working and yes, i have been working and living in london for more than 1 year under a highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP) and i subsequently switched to Tier 1 (General).  bear in mind - i got my visa way before the uk recession and jobs were easy to come by. now unemployment is a big issue here. you won't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job.  anyways, it is unlawful to reject your application if you :- 1) have met the minimum 75 points  2) can proof that you meet the required English standard 3) have minimum funds of GBP2800. 4) obviously, you must not have any prior criminal convictions or have previously abused your immigration status(i.e. overstayed on a visa, outstanding fines in uk, etc)  don't bother applying if you don't meet the above. for me, application to approval took 3 weeks, applying from KL, Malaysia.  for precise requirements and how points are calculated, see http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf21pbsgeneralmigrant#6375036  good luck.  ~Live like there's no tommorrow~
Q26_C4	am so lucky to have your advice i am so lucky to have your advice, knowing that u went through the same procedures before. what do u mean "you won't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job". actually i am not renewing, and do they gauge their approval by the required profession on top of the ones u mentioned. did u validate ur degrees with NARIC, any advice here? must be the bank statement not older than 7 days or it is fine to be a bit older? i have applied TOEFLE for more than 5 years ago, do they take this into consideration? please advise, thanks v much indeed
Q26_C5	No probs.. the tier 1 general visa is for 24 months only. to extend your stay beyond 24 months you must renew it. you won't be able to do so without a job.  as far as i know, you must have at least a bachelor's degree and that's how they accept that you are 'highly skilled'. they want ORIGINAL documents, no copies. don't worry they will return these to you.  bank statements - latest 3 months showing minimum of GBP2800 and must be original as well.  TOEFL is accepted, marks must be 110-120 (internet based test). you must also provide the original cert and test scores.   ~Live like there's no tommorrow~
Q26_C6	one more query do u think that they accept notarized copy of my certificates and not original ones? is it possible to get ur email for future correspondence? thanks so much, you have been v helpful to me
Q26_C7	thanks so much for ur reply, greatly appreciated

Q27_C1	RE: can anyone help me! I recommend buying them Melatonin. I started using it 3 weeks ago. I get sleepy soon after taking 2 and I have a great sleep. I don't wake up with that lingering tiredness that something like, say, Panadol Night, does. The pharmacy opposite Carrefour in Villagio definitely has it for about QR36 and I'm sure you'll find it at other pharmacies (no prescription needed of course).  Best of luck!

Dont let them sleep for a day in the morning.at night they will fall asleep.continue this for a week.they will get used.don't ever change the sheddule time.put them on bed on time.Let them be entertained during day time.and not allow at night.  If they are toddlers they usually dose'nt want to sleep.they try to experience the surroundings.Make them to understand that night is to sleep or rest.Don't use lights which are bright.try not to use or a very mild power.don't encourage them at night to talk/play/have snacks..etc.So they'll feel the night boaring and they automatically go to sleep.  Try some bedtime stories.give them a bed time and never ever change it.Be stricked on the rule.I think it will work out surely.

The baggage rules have changed a LOT and we nearly got stung for US$525 for three bags earlier this month.   As recently as October 2008 you could fly from the U.S. to Doha on Qatar Airways without the carseats counting toward your baggage requirement at all.  In other words, you were allowed two bags per passenger. . .so if there were two adults and two (paying) kids then you were allowed eight bags PLUS the two car seats.  But no longer. . .now you would be allowed six bags plus two car seats.  Anything over that costs US$175 *per bag*.  We learned this the hard way, so it's not an urban legend for us :(
Q40_C4	RE: Are there any companies in Qatar that hire out Baby... Oh - and to answer your question (sorry 'bout that!) I am not aware of any companies that hire them out.  Car seats, in particular, are generally not used outside of the expatriate crowd. :(  You can find what you need at the City Center Babyshop store, but depending on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you.

Q49_C1	if the wife is under the if the wife is under the sponsorship of his husband he can freely tranfer to any company.
Q49_C2	she can she works with gov under her husband sponsring as well ?

Q49_C4	Well, it's a bit more complex Well, it's a bit more complex than that. If she gets a job that allows her to stay under her husband's sponsorship she can change without an NOC. Some jobs require you be under their sponsorship. Mandi

Q52	Greek Embassy Wheres the Greek Embassy in Doha?  Contact details would be appreciated...  Thanks! :)
Q52_C1	RE: Greek Embassy Consular services for Greek nationals  Cyprus Embassy in Doha is represents the consular interests and diplomatic protection of Greek nationals who live and work in Qatar since there is no Greek Embassy in the country.  Greek nationals can certify documents, signatures and ask for a permanent resident certificate. The price for the certifications is 5 (around QR40 depending on exchange rate)  Also Cyprus Embassy keeps a mailing list where Greeks and Cypriots who live and work in Qatar are encouraged to register. The mailing list is updated daily and every effort is made for the best accuracy. The Embassy distributes security information when necessary and other important information to the registered nationals.  The Greek Ambassador to Qatar is the Ambassador of Greek Embassy in Kuwait. Since Cyprus has not started issuing shengen visas yet, visa applications for Greece are being processed by the Embassy of France.  For more information please contact the consular section of the Embassy.  check this link, http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Doha.nsf/All/85D1B7B79AB8FFFE432571D4002E8729?OpenDocument

Once you made the right, follow through - maybe the second right and another right till you see some vans belonging to a construction office.

Q61	Bringing Books From Sharjah To Qatar Dear Qlers,   can you please advise how i can bring some books from dubai to Qatar  books belong to physiotherapy used books for my reference. appreciate your kind guidance.   5-6 books only
Q61_C1	RE: Bringing Books From Sharjah To Qatar many thanks for your valued support but as usual books are heavy around 8-9 kgs total. if i use postal am sure i will end up paying a huge charges any other alternative..
Q61_C2	RE: Bringing Books From Sharjah To Qatar well, then i guess you could check and see who is coming to qatar from dubai, and request them to get the books for you. but to be honest, i don't think anyone would be willing to fill in 8-9 kgs of their own luggage space, just to get books for someone else! , thinkin this way, you might find the shipment option more helpful!  you might have to do a little homework on checking out which shipment companies gives you the best price, and instruct the seller/sender accordingly :)  alternately, try looking for those books in qatar, i.e. in jarir bookstore.
Q61_C3	RE: Bringing Books From Sharjah To Qatar ani chy has given you the right answer. If you dont want to spend money on shipping charges you should find someone who is coming from U.A.E and also willing to take you 9kg load free of charge but most probably a very difficult way.

Q62	About Resignation? One of my friend is working here in Qatar for 4 years,he is planning to resign and go back to his country of origin.He was asking does the company will give any seperation pay?if yes,how is it to be computed?lenght of service or whatsoever?
Q62_C1	RE: About Resignation? gratuity -40 days of basic salary he will get ,since he worked 4 years .
Q62_C2	RE: About Resignation? Per Qatar labor laws: 21 days basic salary is gratuity for each year worked.  4 year * 21 days * last daily basic pay = Gratuity Amount
Q62_C3	RE: About Resignation? 1-calculation of gratuity as per qatar labor law is 21 days basic salary of each year. if u worked 5 years or more it will become 1 month basic salary instead of 21 days.  2. Each year u have a right to get 21 days leave salry, if u not get in previous years, u can claim for this also. 3. All of the calculation based on the last basic salary u got. Eg. suppose on the time of ur joining ur basic salary is 5000 and now u r getting the basic salary 7500, the calculation is based on the last one measns 7500. 4. If ur contract is defenit contract u should give 2 weeks notice informing ur resignation. if ur contact is indefinit duration contact u must give 1 month notice about ur resignation. other wise they can deduct 1 month salary or remaining balance of days salary from ur settlement.
Q62_C4	RE: About Resignation? he will get only gratuity that 21 days per year as per the last drawn basic, apart from that legally nothing

Q63_C1	RE: is 2750 QR gonna be enough? Hello Queenritz!  Although the accommodation and transportation is provided, the offer is really lame and you'll see that won't be enough for your monthly expenses. Good luck!

Q63_C7	RE: is 2750 QR gonna be enough? 2750 is too much for you. tell the management to reduce salary  range 1500 to 1750, then they will definitely agree with you and you should think that teaching profession is not for money, its a charity too...
Q63_C8	RE: is 2750 QR gonna be enough? It would be enough but not satisfactory. Just do your job very well and soon you can ask for an increase.  Regards

Q65	Is 14500 qar good salary Hi All,  I got a job offer from qatar they are offering me 14500 per month  and 4000 bonus that would be paid quarterly. This is way more than what I get in India .But do you think this is a good salary in Qatar . I am married and my wife would join me.How much would I be able to save on average a month.  Thank you in advance.
Q65_C1	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary 14,500 is a good salary and the bonus is a plus, u will be paying the rent per month for a 2 Bedroom fully furnished apartment between 7000 to 8000 QR, around 300 for water and electricity bills, then monthly budget for groceries approx. 1000 to 1500. so all in all maximum 10,000 QR, so will be saving around 5,000QR at least.u can save more depending on the life style u choose. life in qatar is good, peaceful, free of worries. so don't worry take a chance , its a good opportunity.
Q65_C2	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary You can find 1BHK semi furnished brand new flats including water and electricity in Doha at Qrs 3500-4000 per month. Grocery, 1000- 1500 Qrs. Petrol and other maintenances, 300-500 if you have an economy car in good condition. Telephone and internet, 250-500. So total monthly expense will come around 6500 - 7000 maximum. You can save half of your salary if you have a good plan. Good luck go ahead this is a good job offer if the company and project is real.
Q65_C3	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary For single it is okay. But for married you won't be saving anything. 1000-1500 living expenses is good for one person only. House rent and food will eat most of your salary. Transportation or car maintenance and education fees is an additional burden to your meagre salary.
Q65_C4	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary Thanks for your inputs.Felt this is a good salary by Asian Standards.
Q65_C5	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary i dont see anybody died here with a salary of 1000QR...depends on your lifestyle...
Q65_C6	RE: Is 14500 qar good salary Yes it's more than good and you don't have a family so easily you can pay your home rent and your car Car payments , the rest of your salary you can do some shopping and spend a good time with friends
Q66	Car Transfer One of my friend is on visit visa in Qatar, he got permanent Qatari Driving license, can he buy car on his name though he dont have Residence visa?
Q66_C1	RE: Car Transfer How did he get a Qatari Driving License (permanent) without having a Residence Permit and ID?
Q66_C2	RE: Car Transfer cherukkan, He might have got the temporary DL and is confused. They will not issue Permanent DL without RP and ID.   A person on visit visa will not have a Permanent DL of Qatar and will not be able to buy a car.
Q66_C3	RE: Car Transfer please get your facts straight as you cannot get a Permanent Drivers License without an RP. The license is link to your QID and bear the same number.
Q66_C4	RE: Car Transfer the license is connected to the Qatari ID.. if the visa is cancelled the license will have no meaning as well.. he is driving at his own risk similar to not having a license.. if he gets a new sponsor and gets a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be linked to that new ID.
Q66_C5	RE: Car Transfer Dohamarketing is right. You don't need a Driving License to buy a car but you need an RP to buy a car. His Driving License is invalid as his visa was cancelled and he should renew it after obtaining the RP.

Q82	Anyone on  Atkins Diet? Show us some hands! Is anyone out there on an Atkins Diet?  I would like to know what you are currently eating!    It a bit thinner now but i'm tired of eating chicken all the time.  I want to eat something tastier.  I know i'm allowed to eat a lot of other foods, so maybe you can help me out with your suggestions?  What's your no-carb recipe?
Q82_C1	Well,i never tried getting so Well,i never tried getting so fat and too skinny in my entire life.maybe it's an advantage that I don't like to eat something sweet. I eat chocolates once for two months or nothing at all. I just don't like it. I do walk sometimes whenever I get the chance. I eat not too small not too plenty..but my weight is the same. I guess my physique is really like this..But sometimes, i'd still want to lose a few pounds but my friends are telling me no need to lose anything..they tell me i'm getting paranoid sometimes..:(

Q82_C8	I don't know if you guys have I don't know if you guys have read the article in the local english newspaper about some scientific findings that exercising is actually not the key to being skinny....I think that's bull, though.    And anyway, scientists always scares me.  Them and their "findings".    I do try to get exercise when I can, which is not a lot of times since i'm soooo busy lately.  If I can't do that, I go do Atkins.  I loooove eating, and i get so guilty that I have to diet after.  It's like a yo-yo diet.  Not good, I know, but what do I do when I don't have time for exercise?
Q82_C9	Ericdiver I have found that Atkins in Qatar is really difficult... I lost over 50kgs on it and kept it off for 3 years (including 2.5years in Qatar) - then about 2 years ago, I just couldn't contain myself with all the good food - hummous, arabic bread, naan, butter chicken... etc...   Techincally, I shouldn't have had a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with Rocket leaves and onions - or in salad - chicken doesn't have to be your only option.  Brunch at a Hotel on Sundays is brilliant - Berries, eggs and turkey/beef bacon, sausages, meat - thats all allowed.  What about making a smoothie of cream, berries and ice?   Omelettes with mushrooms, greem peppers, diced chicken and cheeze....  There are lots of choices....  Have you seen this....  http://www.atkins.com/Program/low-carb-online-tools.aspx  There is a tab that will take you to meal plans and recipes.... try it:-)  You have just inspired me to start again....
Q82_C10	Xena, thanks! Wow, 50 kgs!  I don't think I inspire you...I think it is the other way around!  Thanks for sharing. :)     From what I know, I'm not allowed to eat fruits.  Berries are fruits, right?  I'm still in induction phase, sorta.  I'm at it for almost 2 weeks now, and believe you me, I lost almost 3 kilos already!  It works, it works, it works people!  Ok, after the induction phase then I can start introducing carbs in my diet...by now i've no appetite for carbs, really.  I've lost it couple of days ago.  I'm just bored with the same old food that's all.  I guess my problem is i'm too tired to prepare something new and something on my own.  Lazy, lazy, lazy.  Eating out is a pain, since if you eat steaks (which I loooove) you get carbs as side dish.  I don't want to be tempted!  Quickest way is the good ol' chicken.  I shouldn't complain I know.  I'm switching to kebab.    Thanks for the tips, i'm going to try out your suggestions!

Q82_C22	Eat Eggs I was/am on Atkins quite frequently and lost weight also. But I found some problems like getting hyper on staff/customers, not been able to talk much etc etc. So I dont observe atkins regularly. May be two weeks on atkins and then break for some days/week and then again on atkins.  Yes atkins certainly helped me in loosing weight . Foods you can include (apart from chicken) is eggs ( all type), zero cola, bottle gourd, egg plant, okra,cheese, fish, tuna, salads. One thing more is>>> lime juice once in day (especially in morning before food). This is not recommended in Atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in making your food balance to more alkaline compared to acidic food.

Q84_C1	well as we all know tht the well as we all know tht the prices here are way to expensive thn in US, that is the onl reason i was looking out for a dealer in Washington, i was in touch with a dealer in NY who is also accosiated with Amazon, who had given me a good price for the camera and the lense, but the only problem is tht i am bit nervous in having it shipped out via courier, but then when a friend of mine told me tht he is flying to washington and if i cud find a reputed dealer in there he could pick it up for me and for sure will be cheaper as i can save on the customs duty and the courier charges.

Q84_C7	Blood, the problem is that Blood, the problem is that for high end cameras, it's still cheaper  including delivery to get them shipped from USA, than it is to buy them here.  I bought my 5D on holiday in KL and a friends 7D in HK - they both worked out about 1/2 price compared to Doha

Q93_C4	My wife is on these My wife is on these supplements for low stomach acid, she has not joined me out here yet, but we were going to get them sent from the UK as we weren't sure if they are available here. It might be worth trying the internet if you have a PO box that they can be sent to, when my wife ran out of them she found it helpful to eat an orange with a meal as this does increase the stomachs ability to break down the fats. Don't use a lemon as these turn alkiline in the stomach and make the problem worse. Good luck

Q99	Can anyone recommend a painter? The painter that our compound mgmt sent over was clearly gouging us - he wanted 1,500QR per room, which is more than it would cost in the U.S. .. .and I know the guys here are making much much less than the immigrant labor in Texas.  Any recommendations for someone who will do a good job for a fair price?  Thanks,  Expat Sueo
Q99_C1	Painting is very easy and a Painting is very easy and a fun job to do. You can buy the paint at any Jotun shop, where they will mix it by computer to any shade you want. Then get some rollers and do it yourself. You will save a lot of money and you will feel so much better after you have completed the job. Really rewarding. I love painting my house and have done everything myself. Aisha-Taweela
Q99_C2	200Qr is what we spent for each room. They are more than ripping you off. We went to Jotun (there is one in the same place as Party Kingdom near Jaidah Flyover) and bought the paint there and contracted with one of their workers.  He would come over at night after his regular job was done.  this was somewhat inconvenient, but he was good and cheap!
Q99_C3	deedee I ended up finding someone to paint the three rooms for 1,000QR.  It's more than 200/room, but he paints for a number of people in the compound and brings his own supplies.  I need to scurry on over to pick up the paint tomorrow!  cheers,  Expat Sueo
Q99_C4	haha kamranhassan! Don't let me fool you. . .I'm blessed by plenty of bad luck as well.  I have more "strange bad luck stories" than you could possibly imagine!
Q99_C5	Expat Sueo. Dear ,   Than you should close to GOD always pray for your luck. Its doest not matter.  I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it, and I'm afraid of people who do.   Luck to me is something else; hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't/   When the good luck comes - ready to receive it.  Always count yourself in lucky persons..  Thanks
Q99_C6	you were right on, SPEED The person who came did it for 1,000QR and did a fantastic job.  The guy who wanted to do it for 4,500 must have been smoking something!
Q99_C7	U R ALWYAS COUNT UR LIFE WITH SMILES...
Q99_C8	deedee do u have phone number for guy who done ur painting,pm me thanks
Q99_C9	painting cost is a tricky issue the 200 and the 1500 sound logical. it really depends on the extent of work. it could be simple painting and applying one or two layers of normal paint. It could be also a complicated task which involve scraping, priming then doing several layers of paint.  ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

Q100_C6	@svelte "Driving a vehicle loaded in such a way that it cause damage to people and surroundings" - this usually means speeding and it is caught by the radar at traffic lights if you cross the speed limit for that road.  You can go to Traffic Dept at Old Airport or Madinat Khalifa  and request to see a video of the violation. Ur dad can tell if its his car and move accordingly.  The place zones can often be misleading due to error in data entry. But timing will be accurate, only our minds play tricks on timings.  Worth checking out the video than speculating.
Q100_C7	dear svelte ... its happened with me once and they mention that driving a car which is above 50 meters or the level allowd in website and when i checked in arabic then i find out its a seat belt panelty ... when they enter in there system at traffic dept they enter in arabic and then system is translating in silly enligh option which is enterd already from there side at traffic dept.
Q100_C8	SS.... this comments appeared ONLY incase of speeding and caught by Radar (Salwa roads or Corniche, elsewhere)
Q100_C9	QR500. But then these LC's QR500. But then these LC's are parked in the middle of the road waiting for groceries without any tickets issued
Q100_C10	+3 points +3 points
Q100_C11	I received a ticket on line and I made a enquiry also online and explianed that I was at work at the time of the incident. The violation disappeared. Make sure you are inputting the proper type of license plate. Cars are private vehicles and trucks are private transportation, don't pay someone else's fine by accident, unless it's mine.   I don't think we need to do anything in the name of God, he's a big boy and can take of himself.

Q117_C14	John Stewart Did you see his recent interview with Katy Couric (who anchors the CBS Nightly News show).  It's kind of scary when you think that the Daily Show (which I love and do watch daily--at least on the 4 days a week it runs) could be the primary source of news for certain demographics in the US.  I like the PBS News Hours.  It's the only US show that actually covers the days news in depth.  BBC world does a good job.  Fox news is appalling in its slant, especially as it pretends to be objective news (at least MSNBC, which slants in the other direction doesnt pretend to be news instead of opinion).  CNN is OK.  Outside the US and UK, Al Jazeera International really does do a good job of presenting a more third World centered view.  As for Qatar news: fugetaboutit, best source seems to be QL
Q117_C15	UkEngQatar ..Very BORING! Any local channel would have extensive coverage of their leaders' international visits.

Q117_C30	noms..Was Waiting to Hear "Al-Jazeera" While I do have high regard for Al-Jazeera English, simply because the Arab world is in dire need for its voice to be heard in main languages, and to balance out international media coverage, but I don't think it's the most objective, no.

Q117_C32	Insha'Allah, Happy Happy I think they will grow and mature. But if they want to be viewed as anything but an anti-Western mouthpiece they will need watch their editorial bias. Fox doesn't care about such things and is happy to be seen as the Right Wing network it is. I would hope that A-J doesn't follow that same path.  They are positioned (and funded) to make great contributions international media. Unfortunately, as long as they allow someone's politics to color their reporting, they will be marginalized.  I think you get the best sense of what's going on by watching a lot of different news. I watch BBC, CNN, AJE, and MSNBC.

Only difference is the social allowance, which I dont get but as they are Qataris they dont get housing.... With my housing allowance I actually make more than my Qatari counterparts.   As for their inflated titles, thats a different story. I have a person in a position above me who gets to sit and read the paper all day and make double my salary... thats something different all togther.   _______________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q125_C2	Rasha, ask yourself, "why Rasha, ask yourself, "why does Dubai have all the things Qatar doesn't?" You should find the simple answer that Dubai's Oil and Gas reserves are dwindling and they are boosting tourism as a revenue earner.  Qatar is sat on a huge gas bubble and doesn't <i>need</i> tourism as much.  And at the end of the day, if you like Dubai and what it has to offer so much, you could always move there, but till then, be satisfied with what you adopted host country has to offer.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3450023228/" title="West Bay Panorama April 2009 by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228_950f2210ff_m.jpg" width="240" height="68" alt="West Bay Panorama April 2009"

Q131_C10	Actually Sherborne is the Actually Sherborne is the second highest fee chanrging school after the Ameriacn School of Doha.. ASD?  ----------------- "HE WHO DARES WINS" Derek Edward Trotter
Q131_C11	Getting what you pay for What's unusual is that you get what you pay for. With many of the schools in Doha you can pay a fortune and still not receive a good education.
Q131_C12	Even if sherborne double Even if sherborne double thier fees tomorrow, I would still send my son there. Its worth every penny.
Q131_C13	Confused by spelling comment qatbrit has used the right 'their' and 'there' in her message - have I missed something??!    Having just visited a number of schools in Qatar I was very much impressed with the importance placed on learning the 3'Rs in primary school.  I know for a fact in the UK that in British schools the spelling is appalling - teachers don't want to correct mistakes just in case the feelings of the child are knocked!!  I personally found Doha College to be way above its station - unable to respond to emails requesting a visit and then when they did, they could not arrange a whole school visit requiring us to visit twice if we wanted to see both primary and secondary.  I will not bother - I can not imaging how they would deal with a case of bullying if a whole school visit was beyond their capabilities.  Maybe they don't need more pupils coming to their school - I do know that resting on your laurels is never good.  I expect the teachers at Doha College are good but if their administration is as weak as it appears parents will take their children elsewhere for fear of bad management.  First impressions still count!
Q131_C14	Sherborne How much can the extras go up to a Sherborne? Are those usually covered by the company? And how have you folks found the school so far? It seems to offer a lot of extra-curricular activities and has a good backing.  Any other schools that you'd recommend - my sons are 6 and 3.5   Cheers
Q131_C15	Qabrit - I am assumng your Qabrit - I am assumng your company is paying here ;) Do they also cover the extras?  Cheers
Q131_C16	I am a mother of a 6 yr Hi,   I am a mother of a 6 yr old boy and is looking for a good school in Doha. I recently got a call for an opening for my son at Sherborne.I am confused as I have also heard about ASD that its also a very good school. As yr child is in Sherborne, Can you please let me know how the school is? should I opt for Sherborne or wait for ASD to reply? How are the teachers at Sherborne? Hows the atmosphere? are u satisfied?  Please let me know your feedback. I will really appreciate. Thanks,
Q131_C17	Sherborne Qatar Sherborne Qatar is a school run as a business making profit.  It is owned by one of the Al-Thani mob. There are lots of problems with this school.  Many higly experienced teachers left after just one year and a another teacher recently quit. They have tried to set up a British Prep school in the desert - it just does not work.  Few of the remaining staff have much international experience - most of them are snobby types from the UK with little overseas experience or knowledge about Arab customs. The organisational of the school is poor - reactionary management. Contact with the Head is limited. They have a Board of Govenors made up of pompous types. There are very few decent schooling options in Qatar and it looks like that Sherborne Qatar will never live up to the advertised promises. Avoid for now - far too many problems related to cultural adjustment.
Q131_C18	Susan Chang can you back your claims Susan Chang, you make lots of claims but what is your proof? Do you have or did you have a child at Sherborne?  My personal experience as a qualified teacher, who has supported many of the students at Sherborne, has been very positive. In fact I was sceptical about how well a new school could do in its first year. I have been quite surprised by what they have achieved so far both academically and in terms of students' holistic development.
Q131_C19	To Mr. Joe90 My proof is that I am friends with several teachers and families currently at the school or who have recently left.  I stand by all I have said.  There are really no decent schools in Qatar.  It is absurd to think you can set up a British Prep School in the middle of the desert.  The whole operation is a business shum run for money - a profit making venture trading upon a famous name.  There are a bunch of pompous UK Govenors who have a lot of egg on their faces at the moment and are doing everything to avoid swallowing their pride.  The only reason the majority of the teaching staff did not leave last year is because they were granted a 10% lump cash sum payment to basically remain hush and avoid speaking out.  What more would you like to know?  The only reason the school survived its first year was because of the teachers, not for any other reason.  The same can be said for many if not all the schools in Qatar.
Q131_C20	Sustaining a corrupt system Quite frankly any school in Doha indirectly helps to sustain  a corrupt system of government (a Family Dynasty), that directly depends on the mass importation of hundreds of thousands of poor people from countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  These people are totally exploited and treated like modern day slaves.  They survive on about 800 QR a month.   No school in Doha can deny that they indirectly helps to sustain such a system.  That is why I say that there are no good schools in Doha.  Their moral foundations are corrupt.  It has nothing to do about IVY league universities.   Decent people should get out of this sham of a country.   Sherborne UK has jumped into bed with a corrupt family and have had their fingers badly burnt.  They now lack integrity and all that they propose they stand for back in the UK.
Q131_C21	they seem ok we moved from Dubai too and my kids are going to the same school, they seem to be alright however I am not quite sure about how strong are they in their acadamics
Q131_C22	Sorry Susan Chang but using your own logic, you and your husbands jobs (or you emotionally supporting your husbands decision to work here in Qatar) are sustaining your employers, who in turn, are "sustaining corrupt family monarchies who deny their citizens and visitors basic human rights and freedoms".  Therefore the only logical option open to you is to leave.  This is the first time I have suggested that anyone should leave Qatar  - but unfortunately this is the corner you have painted yourself into.
Q131_C23	Susan Chang first of all, the only reason Sherborne established a branch here because it's part  of the supreme council of education "Education for a New Era" Outstanding Schools Initiative. which is a RAND initiative (if you know what i mean).So far, Qatari students  accounts for less than 10% of the total number of students . Most Qataris enroll their offspring in government schools.  Overall, Private schools target expatriates who works here, and the fact is  most of the expatriates who enrolls their offspring in private schools receives education allowance from  their employers    And let's be honest, most of you wishes deep inside that your countries are a monarchy. The immigrants are sucking your resources dry, Degrading your national health & education systems. Despite all that your salaries are deducted as taxes to pay for the welfare of those immigrants. And  yet, you got to pay for utilities ;)
Q131_C24	Insightful Paragraph Hello Genesis,  Would you adopt a Affirmative or Negative viewpoint?   Schools like Sherborne have put into place racially discriminatory quota systems of not enrolling more than 20% Qatari students, not 10% as you did suggest. Of course Sherborne can get away with this in Qatar and would never be able to implement such an unfair policy back in the UK.   Your paragraph about immigrants sucking the national health and education system dry is sheer nonsense. A simple and poorly worded opinion without evidence or substance.    As for Adley, I am pleased that you have managed to reach some sort of conclusion.  I really think that all highly trained Western Expats including yourelf should leave Qatari, not just me!  More debate is required.
Q131_C25	School demographics is an issue School demographics is an issue in the UK just as much as it is in Qatar. It is difficult to maintain a high standard of learning if a large proportion of students in a classroom are not fluent in the language of instruction. The way most private schools in the UK address this issue is by setting a limit on the percentage of non-native speakers of English. Otherwise, the majority of the population in these schools would consist of Indian and Chinese students. This is because of the sheer volume of applicants from these two countries.  In Qatar those schools, with a small population of first language English speakers, such as QIS and Al-Jazeera Academy, tend not achieve the same standards as those with more first language speakers.  This does not mean that those students who are not fluent in English are less able but it does show that not being fluent in a language can be a barrier to learning.
Q131_C26	School Review - Doha Academy (so typical of Qatar's Schools) Academic integrity of school 2  Effectiveness of administration 2  Academic and disciplinary support provided 2  Director's involvement in academics 2  Fair and equitable treatment by board and director 2  School has adequate educational materials on hand 5  Attitude of local community towards foreigners 5  Cost of living in relation to salary (10= most favorable) 3  Satisfaction with housing 2  Community offers a variety of activities 6  Availability and quality of local health care 6  Assistance with visas, shipping and air travel 1  Extra curricular load is reasonable 5                 Comments: Sheikha Aisha owns and operates this substandard 'international' school. Don't be fooled, it's an international school in theory but an Islamic school for delinquent Al Thani children. All the students that have been expelled or refuse entrance to another school know they can attend Doha Academy.  Mr. Farouk, head of the secondary school, is abully who rules through intimidation. He has his minions who follow him around like hungry puppies hoping that he'll throw a bone their way. Anyone who dares to stand up to him is a target of his. He derives immense pleasure in humiliating and demoralizing students. How this man was ever appointed in a school boggles the mind.  Sheikha Aisha, the owner/operator, is notorious for not honoring contracts. Foolishly I thought that once a contract was agreed to and signed, it would be honored. Not so. She has blatantly broken contracts because she decided she didn't want to pay airfare. The Sheikha is a dishonest, disreputable woman who is only after two things, money and prestige. She's getting plenty of cash from the parents but refuses to reinvest it in the school.  Working for Sheikha Aisha is a miserable experience. Now that she has turned the day to day operations over to Mr. Ali as Head of Secondary Girls and Mr. Farouk as head of secondary boys, the school will take a dramatic downward spiral. (As an aside, both Mr. Ali and Mr. Farouk have in the past been taken to the police for assaults on students. These assaults took place during normal school hours. Members of staff intervened in order to stop the altercation from becoming a brawl. Yet, they remain thanks to the Sheikha.)  Unless you want to work for and be sponsored by a woman who has zero integrity, no qualms about breaking a contract and no ethics, run a million kilometers in the opposite direction. No one of any repute should ever consider working at this school.
Q131_C27	Wow susan..those are pretty Wow susan..those are pretty inside stuff you're bringing out. I've my child going to sherborn in reception and so far i'm pleased with the teacher and school system. Though this is my first year and i've yet to explorer. but my child is happy. I guess what ever happens in the background as long as it does not direclty effect the teching Quality. but assaulting the student is a serious crime if this is true.
Q131_C28	Sherborne We are all looking for the same standard of education  they we get at home, and if we are putting our children into a private school, then the standard should be even higher.  Not seeing this with Sherborne, they are doing what all the other schools do and that's drop the level because they have too many 2nd langugage students.  Sherborne, is being filled with too many children to soon just to but bums on seats, and running on it's reputation from the UK.  It has no western admin staff, a balance would nice.  Why is that private schools are running with 22+ in class, in England a private operates with 12 maybe 15.  The homework is shocking, no grammar, no comprehension, no maths, science, history, french, geography yet to had this term....thinking about moving my child if things do not improve.

Q143_C1	RE: international driver's license...valid for how long? it will work for 15 days from the date of entering the country. i used my int. drivg license for 2 weeks and then i made a qatari one.
Q143_C2	RE: international driver's license...valid for how long? IT IS VALID FOR 6 MONTHS FROM THE DATE YOU ENTER THE COUNTRY IT IS WRITTEN IN QATARIS LAW
Q143_C3	RE: international driver's license...valid for how long? depends on the insurer, Qatar Insurance Company said this in email to me <blockquote>Thank you for your email! With regards to your query below, a foreigner is valid to drive in Doha with the following conditions: Foreign driver with his country valid driving license allowed driving only for one week from entry date  Foreign driver with international valid driving license allowed driving for 6 months from entry date  Foreign driver with GCC driving license allowed driving for 3 months from entry date</blockquote> As an Aussie your driving licence should be transferable to a Qatar one with only the eyetest (temporary, then permanent once RP sorted).
Q143_C4	RE: international driver's license...valid for how long? The above is for a private car  Most hire car companies (check with them) will only allow 7 days on your Aussie license or two weeks on your internation. These periods are from date of entry into Qatar.  You won't lose your Aussie licence, you just get a qatari one as well.

Q146_C10	interestingly true. Best response so far Srishti. I agree the authorized dealer workshops are also nothing but rip-offs. I personally know of some top branded car dealership workshops who take the cars from the customers and send it to these shady garages to reduce their cost, then they stamp their seal and call it 'Agency maintained', but they rip off the customer 20 times more than the roadside garages too. And i cant agree more about the 90% roadside mechanics all over the industrial area. None can be trusted.

Q146_C15	my experience. I went to Kuwari garage on street 18. They didnt really get up from their lazy benches to check the car when i told them what problems i had or what changes i need. They just told me the price. Their price is good but they didnt guide me. Then i went to the newly established Maysore garare in street 48. The guys there have worked in the actual dealerships (toyota) and the owner is also an ex-dealership workshop guy. They actually drover my car, tested all gears, lifted the car and i had 5 men checking every small detail. Then the told me what i really need and what i could do without. There was no extra charge for all this coz i told them i will do all my work with them. I had new spark plugs and a new fuel filter that i told them to replace and they did that for QR 110. On top of all they all speak good english.I choose mysore over Kuwari anytime.

Q161_C3	RE: Flu Vacinations The SEC will issue consent forms for children to receive seasonal flu vaccinations.  We understand that these forms will be issued on Sunday 4 October, to be returned on Monday 5 October.  The intention is to begin vaccinations against seasonal flu as soon as possible.             They confirmed that without the consent of parents they will not vaccinate children.           H1N1 vaccine is not yet available  more news from the SEC on this will be forthcoming in due course.           The SEC have no plans to vaccinate adults in school at this stage.
Q161_C4	RE: Flu Vacinations I am not a medical person, and would like to know the advantages and dissavantages of giving this to my child, also if the advantage outways the dissavantage, because i would feel quilty if something happens to my child due to my refusal to give her this vacination.
Q161_C5	RE: Flu Vacinations Please all remember this vaccination is only for seasonal flu and not the H1N1 strain. SO think before signing do you really need it? It will not protect your child from Swine flu..

Q167	Marriage Leave Dear All  I would like to know that is there any rule in qatar labor law which states that a person can get a marriage paid leave for certain amount of time?  your answers and suggestion would be greatly appreciated.
Q167_C1	RE: Marriage Leave It amazes me that a Qatari asks such questions, thought they would no more than the rest of us.  I suppose though Marriage is a death, either to the husband (slow and lingering) or to the wife if she changes her name, the birth of a new woman (already mature) and the death of the old as the name no longer applies.
Q167_C2	RE: Marriage Leave No man, there is no such leave in labor law, U gonna take it from ur annual leave balance.

Q169_C1	RE: What to wear?? You can wear whatver you want as long as it doesnt draw attention to yourself. Clothes that cover you and dont show too much skin is ok. You can wear skirts or trousers or jeans or dresses. As long as there is not too much skin show anything is ok...Welcome to Doha!
Q169_C2	RE: What to wear?? Yes I guess Tinkerbell has kind of summed it up. Skirts up to Knee roll are ok I guess..:)  Welcome to Doha
Q169_C3	RE: What to wear?? You have to remember that Qatar is a conservative Muslim Country by Law, but as with most places a lot of the rules are bent here.   The one thing you have to remember which was states before you do not want to wear something that is to revealing so that people do not give you a hard time. For females you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of having inappropriate comments being made and in some cases harassment from both the people and the police.   For men its is a lot easier but some times the same problems arise.   So the best advice i can give is that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing.
Q169_C4	RE: What to wear?? You can wear everything in moderation, as Qatar is a conservative country

Drop me an e-mail through Qatar living and I will try and give you few pointers in the right direction
Q171_C2	RE: How can I get a job in th oil industry when I have no... Short Cuts might benefit you only for a short period. There is no short cut to success according to me.  If you have luck by your side, you can do miracles, if you dont then you need to struggle the hard way. Oil & Gas Industries dont have kids running the show, Professional experience and solid education back ground is need in these sectors.   Good Luck
Q171_C3	RE: How can I get a job in th oil industry when I have no... It is not necessary to have oil related experience or education to get a job in the oil industry. All kind of profesional is needed in the oil industry be it on IT, Engineering, legal, medical or even teacher.
Q171_C4	RE: How can I get a job in th oil industry when I have no... 1- Find the names of as many oil companies and contractors as posible, prepare a good CV (Resume) using the best of your knowledge focus in what ever you know how to do best (don't lie), give a title to your CV (for example: HR officer, secretary, tea boy what so ever) now apply online and personally against all positions available related to the field you know best.   2- Keep your phone with ya, you don't want to missed a call!! while waiting for any interview appointments, go to get urself a good suit and polish your shoes lol (shave and cut ur hair), you only get one chance to make a good impression and be lucky enough to have "the golden opportunity to "develope ur new career", be confident at all times.  " THAT SHOULD DO IT"   GOOD LUCK!

Q178	Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston,USA I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston, It is no need to be directly flight. Anyone can suggest me?
Q178_C1	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... Qatar Airways would be best .
Q178_C2	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... Go for Emirates.
Q178_C3	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... Try searching the net patiently for the dates of travel as the rates vary from date to date or else you can talk to some travel agents.
Q178_C4	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... qatar airways is selling doh hou doh at the cost of qar5020...i am qr stff..if you need more info...you can cntct me by msg on Q/L.
Q178_C5	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... I've got a really good deal from Doha-Detroit-Doha for only 3200 QR. You can try http://www.kayak.com/ . And I aggree with UKEng, Expedia.com will be good too. But, you need to have a credit card which is issued by Canadian/US institution - that's the drawback of expedia & cheaptickets.  Good luck
Q178_C6	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... best fare or best flight....   I once had a cheap KLM flight, through Amsterdam (a 24hour flight)  I prefer the direct Qatar Airways flight (preferably in Business Class)  It's a direct DOH-IAH 17h flight (10am to 5:30pm same day) the flight back is a 15h flight (7:45pm to 7:45pm next day) ... Timezone differences make the numbers seem illogical :)
Q178_C7	RE: Which Airway offer the best fare from Doha to Houston... Like mentioned before, Qatar Airways is the best bet. A flight from Doha to Houston will be around 1400 usd depending on the time of year you go. For example, a flight near Christmas time would be a couple hundred dollars more expensive. I've searched taking a longer flight with layovers and it is always over a thousand more so it's sooo not worth it.

Q184	Water in public wash rooms Why public toilets in Qatar are so dirty Even you go to 5 star hotels or any good restaurants there toilets are spilled with water all over. Is it necessary to have a water in toilets ? In western world there is no water in the public toilets and they are very clean. Last week i went to Shark Village one of the top hotels in the country and was not able to use the toilet as it was all spilled with dirty water suggestions please
Q184_C1	If so many people are so If so many people are so disgusted by it, why does it persist?  Why does everyone just accept that this is the way things are in Qatar?  It just boggles my mind that management at all the major shopping centers fell no compulsion to offer clean and sanitary toilets to patrons, or that the municipality doesn't enforce any cleanliness standards.  I just don't know how people can live like that.
Q184_C2	this, unfortunatley is this, unfortunatley is acceptable to some  and some feckwit thinks that westerners are dirty by using bog roll???!! Perlease!
Q184_C3	Umm Adam is so correct Go to Disneyland where it is far more crowded than any place in Qatar and you won't smell any stink from Western people!  Here in Qatar it is such an ordeal to stand in queue in some public place or in huge crowd because of smelly stinky odor from certain folks who do not believe in washing their bodies and clothes before venturing in public  Again, have you ever seen filthier bathrooms than here: Landmark, City Center, Waqif, Hyatt, Villagio, McDonalds, Burger King, ....... everywhere!!!!!  Why is Dubai so much better?  Why Mosques in Dubai are 100x cleaner than Doha?????
Q184_C4	I was staggered by the filth I was staggered by the filth in the public toilets at Souq Waqif.  I'd rather piss against a wall than set foot in those toilets again.  Whoever is 'running' Souq Waqif is useless.  The place is an utter embarrassment for tourists in that regard.  If you want anyone to have a meal and spend more than an hour there, they will need toilets... and this is the number 1 place to take tourists in Qatar?  I guess it's a true reflection of the filthy attitude of many people in this country.    No wonder western tourists hate the place.
Q184_C5	All this talk of toiletary All this talk of toiletary taboos might help explain the incredibly high rate of sterility amongst the local population.  It can't be clean having so much urine and faeces swirling around on the floor, walls and misting into the air.  Perhaps that's why the local men and women have so much trouble conceiving.

Q184_C13	I have questions about the I have questions about the hose thing..... 1) How do you know you have all the faecal matter off?? So fingers physically touch faeces?...nice 2) Do you use the paper afterwards to ensure all has been removed and to also dry off ones bum? 3) If one doesn't use paper to dry surely it would cause soreness? 4) How come the water goes everywhere? 5) Surely the backsplash from the faecal/urine filled toilet water lands directly back on ones netheregions?  I'm not convinced...one has to use paper somewhere along the line Water all over the floor which I dread to think what lurks in it is quite disgusting and unacceptable.....

Q184_C19	hasan you have GOT to be hasan you have GOT to be kidding me, what the hell are you on about  only reason to why bathrooms stink here is not because of the people who use them, or the way that they use them, its because those shopping centers or hotels dont fork over the necessary money to keep them clean, no proper maintenance, cheaply build and no proper clean up staff.....

Q184_C21	I must agree with Dottie.. The Public toilets in Qatar are revolting.

Q184_C25	Sorry no hard feelings!!! Recently I have visited Doha from Canada for two days. Three things caught my attention right away 1. Water in public washroom, even at the airport. 2. Speed limit and driving style 3. I saw one kid (2-3 yrs old), with no child seat and seat belt on which was pretty scary.  I think it is nothing wrong with using water in a washroom, this is just some people do not have courtesy to leave it clean for the next person. Qatar is one of the richest country (per capita income in 2007 was more than 80K i guess) on this planet, so it is fair to expect that everything should be nice and clean in this country.  hopefully I did not hurt anybody's feelings.
Q184_C26	Alexa I'm not saying that westerners stink...but again I consider the use of toilet paper as an improper and inappropriate habit,this is dirty! I prefer to see water spilled than a used piece of paper,or a roll that has been manipulated by dozens of fingers...  <a href="http://s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
Q184_C27	solution Public toilets should have drains in the floors, and the floor should be built so the foul water flows into the drains rather than form puddles.  I would equally complain if dirty bog-roll was left strewn all over the bathroom, so I think there's no excuse for leaving excrement-laden spray covering the cubicle. However, the problem would be much less apparent if the water drained away properly.
Q184_C28	Toilets in Doha are Toilets in Doha are disgusting and a disgrace!!!  When you arrive at Doha airport and want to use the toilets (speaking of the ladies' of course, can't comment on the gents') the first impression of Doha is NOT GOOD!!!  Only 2 toilet cubicles, both dirty and swimming in dirty water and overflowing bins.  Why oh why can't they build decent toilets in this country??  The toilets in the new malls esp. Villaggio are HORRIBLE!!  Cheaply constructed from formica - water and dirty paper everywhere.  Is it really so difficult??  Go to the malls/hotels/ airport in Dubai and you can see the difference.  Why can't it be the same here??  I will do anything to avoid using public toilets here, which is sometimes very inconvenient, but I don't want to bare my b*m to these hellholes!!
Q184_C29	the worst I think the worst I've seen in any shopping mall are the gents loos in Landmark. There's dried shit stains up the walls and dead roaches in the light fittings.  It baffles me how anyone feels happy shopping for food after using those toilets.

Q184_C34	UK Health Department In the 60's the UK health department advised to use water hoses against toilet paper in the public schools in order to stop typhoid spreading among childrens,sorry I didn't find the link. And Hasan is right to a certain extend,you can't clean that "place" toroughly only if using water,this is common sense. I will not say westerners are dirty people,but I look at this type of hygiene -paper- totally disgusting. And a body with no smell doesn't automatically mean a clean body.  Use a whole roll if you want,this is nothing compared to a well guided water spray,lol!  <a href="http://s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>  Hardcore Gamer!

Q186	Gold's Gym?? OK.  The rumors about the demolition of Gold's Sym appear to be unfounded- I was just there last night looking through the windows and everything is set up like they were ready to open at any moment.  So, what is the deal?  Are they really closed?  If so, why is everything still set up and the lights are on (but nobody's home).

Q189	Will 8000QAR per month enough? I work in the UK on a salary of 17,000GBP after tax. I have a feeling my company will be offering me a comparable salary to work in Qatar.  This does not include any benefits, so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen, 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish.   What do you fine citizens of QL think?
Q189_C1	not enough No way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation.  check QL classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments.  EVERYTHING here is more expensive, except for petrol.  You need to be making a good deal more than you were in the UK.
Q189_C2	Are you sure its QR.8000? A Are you sure its QR.8000? A decent single bed apartment cost 4000 to 5000..whats left? for a car you will have to pay 2000 per month.. so its too less...    <a href="http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/?action=view&current=0003.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/0003.gif" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>
Q189_C3	Just to give you a brief Just to give you a brief idea about living costs in Qatar, take a good look at these facts:  1- Rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3,500 up to 4,500 QAR per month. Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1,000-1,500 QAR per month.  2- Renting a small car (1500 cc) is around 1,500-1,700 QAR per month.  3- Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1,500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink. The previous number increments if you drink alcohol.  4- Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do (that's about 800-900 QAR per month).  5- Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month. Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each (that's another 500 QAR per month).  Need I continue...?! I don't think so.  ********************************* <b> <i> Obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal.

Q192	Police Report What is the process for getting police report for accidents?
Q192_C1	RE: Police Report You should call the Traffic Police and inform them about the accident to enable them to see the accident (but dont block the road if it is a minor accident) or both of the vehicles should be taken to the nearest Traffic Departmen. In this case both parties should agree who is responsible for the accident.
Q192_C2	RE: Police Report 1) Call 999 if you are on the accident spot!  2) In case the accident is minor and fault is accepted by either one, then you both may directly go to the nearest police station and you will get the report instantly.  If third party was NOT involved in the accident & you damaged the car by yourself, you can follow the same procedure # 2 above.
Q192_C3	RE: Police Report you go to police station, bring your documents and get a police report.  possible you need to take a number? but that's the procedure.
Q192_C4	RE: Police Report this is what happened..  on the 26th of january this guy was in a reverse and he hit me.. he admitted his fault and told me whatever the damage he would pay.. i thought that police report is not needed because we both agreed but i was wrong.. do i still need the details of his land cruiser? he gave me his number and he is such a nice guy he would stick by his word but the service center says they wont fix a thing without a police report? i need the location and office timing please.
Q192_C5	RE: Police Report I think you need to go to the police station located in the area of the accident. talk to the guy who hit your car, and agree on a time for meeting at the police station.I think both of you should be present at the station. explain the situation, you may need to pay a fee for paper work, and they may call you the following day for the report. Take your id, id copy, istimara, and insurance documents with you. Make sure that you clear any of your earlier radar fines, to get the report.
Q192_C6	RE: Police Report Call that guy ( who hit your car), and tell him that you will meet in the police traffic division- the nearest police traffic division were the accident took place, to whatever time you are both two comfortable of, since the traffic division is 24hrs, except i think there is no office during friday and saturday.. and if as you said the guy is the culprit then he should pay 100 plus 20QR for the report, and you as the victim will also pay 20QR for the report.. after that check with your arabic friend who can read and interpret the report( since the report is typed in arabic), ask them what is the name of the insurer of the car who hit you, and google their contact nos, lastly  go directly to their office(insurer) and give them the police report.. and the  they will give you the details on what you will do next..   I hope that helps...

If you want to use it along Salwa Road and have a death wish - feel free! At the end of the day, we all see people on quad bikes with inadequate lights and no protection on the roads here at times, so why not a mini bike? Whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality! I trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start! Mini bikes on public roads in the UK set a bad example for the "real" motorcyclists so it won't be any different here. Your call...
Q211_C3	RE: is it okay to ride mini bike in qatar? ow.. but.. i only play at large field near the road.. i know its not allowed to ride in main road.. but.. can i ride in field?

Q212_C5	RE: Super Fuel in place of Premium A higher Octane rating does not have any effect on cars with a normal compression rating.  High Performance Cars got usually a higher compression rating and therefore have to withstand knocking(detonation)
Q212_C6	RE: Super Fuel in place of Premium just use 95 or 97 octane...others will harm the engine...also check your manufacturer's manual...

Q222	Do you shop online with auctions? I am setting up my home and am thinking of trying ebay or similar sites to try to save money. I might try to list some of my things to sell as well.   I am wondering about shipping and fees and so on. Does anyone have experience with this?
Q222_C1	timebandit, I wish I owned timebandit, I wish I owned the site, but I do not. I was hoping to find something like it to use to make purchases.
Q222_C2	ebay Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong, then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free, but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20, which is much faster and secure.  if you are buying from other countries like US, the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post, its take a month too, alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer, then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140.  alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL, or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.
Q222_C3	Thanks, shyams. I am Thanks, shyams. I am thinking of trying the one I listed above just to see how it works. I think it is in Qatar, so the shipping may be better.   I think I will try to sell something first, because the site looks so new - there aren't too many things to buy. I'll let you know how it goes.
Q222_C4	no problem you are welcome.. till now I havent seen any ebay seller from Qatar.....
Q222_C5	mojo, how did the buyers mojo, how did the buyers back out? That kind of stinks. So did they or didn't they get sold in the end? I want to list something and I suppose it's free so I wouldn't lose anything...
Q222_C6	backed out in a sense... backed out in a sense that...they had not read the specs well, though I had them listed, their issue was with the processor of my laptop and also under the assumption that it was with a video card..which it wasn't.  But for me to list it there again, is because I believe it will work..if not now then some other time.  mojo1981
Q222_C7	I signed up, but haven't I signed up, but haven't listed anything yet.
Q222_C8	Let us know how it goes, Let us know how it goes, will  you?
Q222_C9	Well to be honest Well to be honest geekgirl...I just want my items to be sold..and will try various avenues till it gets sold..and being free is an added bonus.  The thing I feel while being in Qatar is that unlike back home in Australia or anywhere else a lot of people know what auctions are...its yet catch up here !!  mojo1981
Q222_C10	excatly the real meaning of Auction is to catch up here.... the reason 1. the country is small, you can always call up the seller directly and negotiate the price. 2. can always drop in to check the stuff yourself. 3. the price. 4. Options
Q222_C11	I agree Shyams... I agree Shayams..for me to give an update, I had used the qlassified.com as an avenue to advertise and sell the items.  What has happened so far is that a resident in A-Khor community bought my HP laptop for a price that was favourable to me...but in the end I sold.  As mentioned earlier my end goal would be to sell my unwanted items through any means....the site I would is doing is job as intended.  I do hope more people would start putting up their stuff as well...as the concept is good while its in Qatar.  Again thats too much text before I head off to Ras Laffan.  mojo1981
Q222_C12	It would be good, It would be good, especially, for people who prefer to not meet in person. I get nervous setting up a meeting with someone I do not know. An auction site might be a good idea as a "middle man".
Q222_C13	great shopping on ebay.. i great shopping on ebay.. i had done several times... shipping cost should be mention on item description, if not just ask the seller... but be careful on reading the fulll description carefuly, regarding like warranty, refund, exchange, damage, geniune, new or used etc...
Q222_C14	online shoping and shipping i think thats hectic for a place like qatar. especially the shipping costs and the time taken to arrive. why dont you try any local shops like home centre or homes r us if its for furnitures? there are a hundred other shops in salwa road for furnitures, household items etc etc etc. wats that u exactly wanna buy?    [img_assist|nid=17892|title=http://braveatheart.blogspot.com/|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=135
Q222_C15	I use eBay in conjunction I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally.  Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address, and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates.  I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.   <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/" title="I Love Photography"><img src="http://www.blodyn.net/images/photographer.gif" width="65" height="64" alt="I love photography" /></a>

Q234	SPECIAL K KELLOGS.......is it useful? Dear all, I wud like to knw how many of u have tried the special K kelloggs Challenge..??was it effective?im skipping 1 meal as per their program to lose sme kgs and instead eating it...has it worked for u??Thanx for sharing ur genuine experiences.....
Q234_C1	RE: SPECIAL K KELLOGS.......is it useful? If you have a Special K meal you will lose weight because you will have a lower calorie intake. Should work.
Q234_C2	RE: SPECIAL K KELLOGS.......is it useful? And to check calories in your food, go for (www.nutritiondata.com)
Q234_C3	RE: SPECIAL K KELLOGS.......is it useful? It can work but the danger is to re-gain the weight once you go back to your normal diet.  If you just want to loose a few kilos to get inside a dress why not (but our bodies do not like very much this kind of games :-).  For a healthier diet, change your way of eating by taking out the extra (extra quantity, extra sugar and fat) and add the good ones (fruits, vegetables and exercise). You may not loose weight as quickly but it will last.  Check your BMI kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) ,decide what BMI you want to reach (to be healthier and/or to fell better) and allow you some time to reach it.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index  And whatever you do (diet, exercise), you have to enjoy it, if not one day or another you will swap to your old habits :-)
Q234_C4	RE: SPECIAL K KELLOGS.......is it useful? Don't replace your meal with special K.  It is high in sugar and is made from simple white flour.  If you insist on eating cereal instead of a normal meal then try eating one that reduces its sugars slowly.  i.e. less refined and more complex carbohydrate.  Dorset muesli for example with nuts and unprocesses grains.  With the simple carbs in special K you will just get an insulin spike and feel hungry soon after.  Generally if you want to lose weight then reduce your carbohydrate and increase green vegetables.  So less potatoes, rice, pasta and as much green vegetation as you can manage.

Q245_C1	RE: can unmarried girls work in qatar? Indeed they can
Q245_C2	RE: can unmarried girls work in qatar? yes, you can and they can...Qatar doesn't ban single women from working. The issue would be not with your gender but with your visa.

Q246	Hamous and Kubus for children My daughter loves to eat Hamous and Kubus (arabic Bread) can any body tell me whether it is good for her health   Thanks.
Q246_C1	Good Enough It is good for growing children but depends how and when it is consumed...  Recomendations A) Early B/Fast B) Early Dinners  Better to consume with more olive oil (Organic/Extra Virgin, First Cold press) as a topping add on.  Two/Three times a week is ok if your staple food is not lentil based.  I assume you will be buying it from famous Hamous guys (Beruit), order it without oil and use your own olive oil as recomended above.  Hope this helps
Q246_C2	Good Enough Please read the second posting
Q246_C3	I would say its marginally I would say its marginally better for her health than KFC and Krispy Kreme doughnuts!

Hummus is high in iron and vitamin C, and also has significant amounts of folate and vitamin B6.[23] The chickpeas make it a good source of protein and dietary fiber. Depending on the recipe hummus carries varying amounts of monounsaturated fat.Hummus is useful in vegetarian and vegan diets and like other combinations of grains and pulses, when eaten with bread it serves as a complete protein.

Q249	Eid Al-Adha Days off? It's my first year in Doha and I'm not sure what days we get off for Eid Al-Adha.   Can anybody tell me which days this year, private sector workers, get off for Eid?  I want to get away for the long weekend but I can't book flights until I know for certain.  Thanks,
Q249_C1	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? You may wish to fly out on 25th Oct Thurs. and return on 3rd Nov Sat. at max.
Q249_C2	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? That can't be right. I thought private sector workers only got three working days off.
Q249_C3	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? u can fly out 23rd night becoz 24 will be arafat it should be  off.u have to be ready for work on 4 th of november.(government employees)private sector wil get only three working days off.i guess
Q249_C4	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? What is Arafat?  To be clear. It's my first year here and I work in the public sector. I need to know what days I get off. I have heard it is three working days.  Please can somebody confirm the dates.
Q249_C5	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? Some people won't get any days off (workers in shops, domestic workers, taxi drivers etc).  Some people will get 1 or 2 days off.  Some people will get 10 days off.  It just depends who you are and whether your manager likes you.  There is no hard and fast rule about who will definitely get a certain number of days off.
Q249_C6	RE: Eid Al-Adha Days off? I agree that is the case in reality. However, Qatari Labour law (Law 14) does make specific provision for Eid Al-Adha holidays.   For private sectors workings it states that you should get 3 working days off. If your manager insists on you working those days, then you are entitled to 150% of your salary for those days.  I don't want to resight labour law, as these laws are not always adhered to.   I just want to know which 3 days this will be this year if your manager just so happens to be a really nice guy and gives you the days off as per the 3 day requirement.

Q251	Are vacations meant for kids or parents/teach Many Indian schools here took winter vacations before actual winter started to join eid with christmas. They started vacations from eid instead of Christmas to help parents of all enjoy eid and christmas. But my kids now finding it very difficult to wake up for school. They simply hate going to school. What are your comments?
Q251_C1	hhhaaa...Buddy, don't u hhhaaa...Buddy, don't u remember our schooling days??? we all were somewhat same like ur kids..Not wanted to wake up early after spending long vacation...Or always used to give lame excuses to the parents...WOW, WHAT A WONDERFUL THOSE DAYS WERE?? Just be calm friend..They r kids after all..They will adjust soon..Try to make them understand with ur love and not by yelling on them..It may give opposite result..It does happen with we adults as well coz of the wintery feel in DOHA from december to february-march..We too feel lazy to wake up for our office sometimes...So be chill...
Q251_C2	soniya, you didn't soniya, you didn't understand my post. I didn't take the vacation as I took just a couple of months before in summer. Its not due to long vacations but due to falling temperatures kids are reluctant to wake up. Hence I feel vacations should not be disturbed to facilitate parents or teachers. Do you justify taking vacations in advance?
Q251_C3	Welcome to the club "But my kids now finding it very difficult to wake up for school."
Q251_C4	blablabla, i had written blablabla, i had written that coz of this utter cold temperature kids r bit reluctant to wake up..Kindly read my post again..Its not even with the children but it happens to adults as well..We feel bit lethargic during winter..So its natural, the kids will feel same..  My daughter is still small to go for school..But i can understand ur problem..Noone can force schools to go as per one's own wish..School authorities r fully responsible towards their children..So evenif i want to justify my stand on vacation,its not gonna to sort out the problem..
Q251_C5	blablabla do they get 8 hours of sleep? blablabla do they get 8 hours of sleep at night?
Q251_C6	best-qatar said it...... that is the truth... and there is no logic in blablablas argument. you make the kids sleep at 9 or 10. and if they get up at 5 , they get 7-8 hours sleep, which is not bad.  Is it the kids find it difficult to get up or the parents who get up early to make kids ready ?... LOL

I didn't want to waste my time if I don't get enough uplift to make a move worthwhile. Like most Expats, I will be coming to Qatar to save more money than I can back home.  I am getting 80k here in the UK, with 15% bonus and a long term tie-in that adds another 15% to 25% depending on how the company share price does.  Of course Taxes in the UK are very high, as is cost of living. But I understand cost of living in Qatar is even higher (?).
Q256_C3	RasGas Salaries Yes it is $ 10k / Month. First of all salaries are tax free here. Also things are cheaper as compared to UK. RASGAS providing excellent furnished villas to expats. Children education is also by the company and graduate / bonuses and leave salaries are also there. Overall best place to work in Qatar is Ras Gas / Qatar Gas.

Long process but it's a must requirements. ;D Might it help to ask your company again whether its ok to do the attestation in Phil Embasssy and MOFA in Dubai? or as what mentioned above, try to inquire P.E. in dubai.

Q269	Does any one know about living in Riadh ?? Hi everyone My husband and I have been enjoing living in Doha for 6 years .Now we have a better job offer in Riadh. We are a moslem Egyptian family, so no problem with the religious atmosphere. But I am worried about how would life be comparing to open Doha, especially for women . sports for kids???places to dine in with the family???parks ???weather conditions???I need help. thanks
Q269_C1	Hazems Mom I was in Saudi before. Everything is there in Saudi about what you are looking for. Life is little difficult for bachelor over there. You can go for shoping alone by taxi. You can ride in a taxi. You can go alone by taxi but you must seat back side not beside the driver. If you wanna take any man with you then he must be your hubby/son/father/brother(not cousin). Always you have to wear abhaya covering your head. Covering face is not mmendatory but ladies covering. As you are muslim, you will feel comfortable wherever you will go. Hotel, restaurant, bank every places there is seperate ladies section available. Weather is little dry then Doha. In weekend you can go to Makkah for Umrah.
Q269_C2	I am still there... I am currently working in Riyadh and going to move to Doha soon. I am also Egyptian with my family. the life style here is different...but don't worry, it will be better if you live in a compound. At least in Riyadh you can visit Mekkah and Madinah as much as you like. plus you have access to all GCC as in Qatar. I agree with all the above positive things about Riyadh. there is nice Club located in the Deplomatic Quarter with good facilities, it is far a little bit but still OK. few negative things but depends on how you can manage it: 1. No enough schools in Riyadh with qualified staff. 2. Traffic is nightmare.
Q269_C3	thanks britexpat You gave me a alittle light at the end of the tunnel !thamks
Q269_C4	I lived in Riyadh until just I lived in Riyadh until just recently and I am a western women - you can walk alone, you don't need your husband with u to go shopping - maybe years ago but not now.  There are plenty of muslim women out without their husbands.  You don;t have to cover your head - unless u already do.  Just make sure u carry a scarf as sometimes as women we do get asked to cover up - you will have to wear an abaya though.  If u do go out with a man - he must be a relative.  You don't have to eat behind curtains in restaurants - that is your choice - but u must eat in the family section.  I loved Riyadh and I wld go back tomorrow.  Shopping is fabulous compared to Doha - 90% off sales - amazing , and sooo much variety compared to here.  Eating out is so cheap also and loads of variety to choose from.  Hope this helps.

Q273_C3	RE: Is Doha a good place for toddlers? Yeah! Agree with UkEngQatar. Doha has plenty of play groups...they are called "majlis"
Q273_C4	RE: Is Doha a good place for toddlers? Well, as of our experience, Doha is the WORST place for Todds and kids. First of all, there aren't many playgrounds only couple but they are always so crowded and the kids are so agressive you don't even want your kid to go near them, the kids here have no respect and no manner, beside it gets super HOT in summer so even forget about the parks.  For sure its better to live in a Villa. I would not recommend living here unless you make some good money to save for your future.
Q273_C5	RE: Is Doha a good place for toddlers? Thanks guys.  Also, any particular area/ compound we should live in?
Q273_C6	RE: Is Doha a good place for toddlers? Hi Alison, I have recently moved to Doha from the UK with a toddler in tow too.  My son is going to be 2 in December so theyre roughly the same age.  There are plenty of mother & toddler groups and nurseries to choose from.  Eventually, youll make friends with little people and be able to socialise with them more often so the children can play together.  Speaking from my own experience, my son is extremely happy here.  He loves the good weather and he enjoys going swimming everyday too.  The heat isnt really an issue, I think the air con is worse to be honest, I'm always cold indoors!  I keep my son out of the midday sun and weve been ok so far (touch wood).  My hubby is home by 4pm ish everyday, so quality of family life is much better here than the UK.  My hubby and son enjoy spending time together here, which wasnt so easily done in the UK.  Im currently living in an apartment, because hubbys company has paid for it for 3 months, but were looking for a villa to move into.  I agree with the others, a villa in a compound is probably the better option.  Anyway, best of luck whatever you decide, feel free to ask any questions.
Q274	Overstaying in Qatar Hi,  Any advice for my friend who just confess to me that he is not currently employed to the company that promised him to process his  working visa but after 11 months now still no action from the company.  Can you guys give us some ideas on what steps we should take. Cause I am thinking of seeking a legal action from the Labor Department or going to a attorney or any other relevant offices to this case.   Thank you,
Q274_C1	RE: Overstaying in Qatar My advice is first try to convince the employer to process your visa as soon as possible. late sallary does not matter. Also inform the employer that you are illegal resident now and will be problem if any emergeny exit required. Also inform the employer with very soft words that if action not taken then you will be left with no option but to consult labor department.

Q294_C3	@rizvi3150 Have you asked the one who assessed you about your driving skills and where have you failed? Because by asking, you might improve and eradicate those mistakes the next time you would go for a license.   When driving always see to it that your eyes are looking on the road and must not look on the shifting gear when you change shift. Because a split second can endanger someone's life or your life.   Slow moving vehicles must always use the right lane. When going for an intersection maybe let other cars pass before you continue. I forgot the right of way on whether you should go or stop. I think it's better for the latter so that you can have a safe trip.  Also maintain a considerable distance if there's a car in front of you. The distance would be the same as if you would imagine that there's an equal size car in between the two of you. Just in case the front car would go and hit his breaks, you would have the ability not to hit the front car with the distance you just imposed.   Hope you would pass next time and kindly tell the one sitting beside you on your next test to tell your mistakes after the result has been given.

Q296_C3	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... I read this thread while researching the Triptic requirements for my drive from Doha to London. Now that I am back in London I think I can dispel some of the myths.  I drove from Doha through Saudi, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany and Holland before taking a ferry to the UK. The car had a Qatari number plate. Saudi first, You do not need a Triptic, just a visa (Transit in my case) which is usually valid for 3 days. There is nowhere to buy a Triptic anywhere near the Jordan border.   Jordan, There is no need for a Triptic or advance visa. This can be bought at the border along with car insurance.  Syria, There is no need for a Triptic. I had a visa from the Syrian Embassy in Doha. Insurance can be bought at the border.  Turkey, There is no need for a Triptic. Visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance.  Greece, no Triptic requirement, Insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole EU for one month.  Having entered the EU, there are no further visa, insurance or Triptic requirements.  Egypt has a Triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in. I would recommend leaving the car in Aqaba and taking the ferry to Nuweiba, where coaches operate to Cairo.
Q296_C4	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... thanks but i think i will not go to Jordan to go to Egypt I think from Saudi to Red Sea To Egypt (((I Think))!!! Does Any one know If it is the same like Jordan in Egypt (Safage)
Q296_C5	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... You must have a tripticket, which is required by the Egyptian law. You also must have a passing visa through saudi arabia. And great amount of coffee to alert you while driving; and great patient on the borders. Have a safe trip
Q296_C6	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... thanks Whatever-7 and Mohammed 1000 But Can i get this tripticket from the borders in Egypt or it is a must to get from Qatar??? If it was from Egyption borders then what is requisted for it????
Q296_C7	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi, look if you want to go to egypt by car you need to do triptek from here since your car has a qatari plate number. I went to lebanon twice, first I went without a triptek but it was a lot of headache especially at Syria borders, since I needed to pay twice on the borders. One when I entered and pass to lebanon and another time when I left lebanon coming back to Qatar through syria borders. I advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you...Enjoy your trip :)
Q296_C8	RE: Can I drive to Egypt without having Triptec from... Hi Friend  Hope u will have a safe trip to Egypt. Yes, u need to get a trip ticket book from Qatar riving club in c ring road with a Qatari sponsorship.  For ur car is still under installment, no problem to leave Qatar but don't ask the bank to give u a letter to leave Qatar with ur car.  Also, u must have a valid Qatari license and u must make car insurance in the Saudi border and it will cost u 75/00 Saudi riyals per trip.   u have two ways to reach Egypt. 1a- thru Deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hours approx.  1b- Thru Deba to Safaga and it will take about 12hours and I dont prefer it.  2- Thru Jordan from Al Aqaba to Sharm el Sheikh and the trip will take about 6 Hours by sea.  I hope that the above information is useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction.

Q305_C3	If you have NEVER worked on If you have NEVER worked on Photoshop before, the best would be to first get ur hands dirty with online tutorials and get yourself familiar with the menu's and just the basic working of the software. Youtube is the best source.  Problem with going for short courses is that they just skim through everything quickly giving u an introduction, showing you what the menus do and other such options nothing useful..all of which you can learn online for free. Once you feel you are good with the basics just enroll yourself for more advanced course where you will fully unleash the power of Photoshop...thats just my opinion for value for money. :P

You can get a modest abaya for around QR 150 and a more elaborate stich for around 300-400. Abayas in this souq can go for thousands but it depends on how elaborate you want it.

Q308_C2	RE: Suggest a place for a family get together.. Well, it depends upon your budget. You could try Asian (located opposite airport, besides Pizza Hut). They have a big hall that can certainly allocate 30 people easily. Or else, try Osra (Mannai-roundabout), they too have a hall you can throw a party. If ur budget is big, then i think u can rent out Taj Resoi at Marriot.

Q326	Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? My family and I are moving to Qatar next year. We lived in Saudi 10 years ago. A co-worker said expat men and women can wear shorts in public in Qatar. I find that extremely difficult to believe. What's the truth?  Thanks, Kevin in Houston
Q326_C1	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? Generally, it's not the done thing. My husband, a carefree sort, wears knee-length shorts to the mall. But my teenage son got accosted my a couple of non-Gulf Arabs when he wore shorts to the mall - so trousers for him.
Q326_C2	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? Yes, you can wear shorts, just not really short indecent shorts.  They should be to the knee and shoulders need to be covered ie no singlet tops for either men or women however many ex-pats do flout this.
Q326_C3	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? It really depends WHERE in public you go.    On your compound or to your kids school is perfectly fine.  I see shorts in all the malls.  But really, it is considered offensive in this culture, and while you won't get arrested, you will get stared at.
Q326_C4	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? All the answers above are correct; Qatar is less conservative than KSA but not nearly as open as UAE or Bahrain.  It's a great place in the middle.  As a man wear your "boy pants" you'll be fine; as a woman same, but more importantly keep the shoulders covered.  You'll be comfortable and won't get a second look.  Coming from Houston, welcome to the nearest corollary weather-wise...!
Q326_C5	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? just don't wear short shorts, we don't want to see the little guy pop out.
Q326_C6	RE: Can you wear shorts in public in Qatar? Wear anything Qatar is not conservative and mad like KSA.

Q335	Living in HMC Compound - what's it like? Hi All We are currently living in Cardiff UK, my husband has been offered a senior management role with Hamad Medical Corporation.  I am wondering what living in a company compound is like...  What kind of standards are the villas? Is there a community feel? What is there to do?  Thanks in advance for you help and comments!
Q335_C1	HI. My husband works for HI. My husband works for Hamad. We are living in a beautiful villa in a compound full of HMC staff. What is great is that all the husbands, and a couple of wives, work in the same department so they are all generally good friends. The facilities in our comound are limited (pool and gym only) however the social life makes up for it. What i do however, suggest is getting out and meeting other people when you arrive so that you have variety to your day. Contact me if you like. I have a 2 year old son who is always keen for play dates.   Best regards,  P1x13

In his discussions with his new boss-to-be my husband has been told that he will have a villa in the compound [so I hope there is room for me! :-)  ]
Q335_C5	Living in HMC compound. Some years ago many HMC senior staff were housed in two-story detached villas in Al Messila compound on the Rayyan Road.  Some do still live there but I don't know whether villas are still allocated to new staff.  The houses are good and, like most compounds here, the recreational facilities provided are quite good (social centre, swimming pool, tennis courts, etc).  I am sure that you will be able to live comfortably here.  However, if you have pets, make sure that the compound will permit them, some do not.
Q335_C6	Bernadette . , ya wel come Bernadette . , ya wel come . i know all about HMC coz my friends are working there and when i was posting reply for u she was with me so i asked here and i posted for you .. dont worry .. BTW why room for u alone ? arnt u r the Wife ?? :D

Q342	Anyone lost a Golden Retriever  ??? We just picked up a Golden Retriever(Friday 11h30am) of C Ring Road near the airport. Anyone know of someone who lost his dog ???  Looks like a domesticated dog with leash and collar still attached.  Pls contact me on 688 6924  or 588 5632
Q342_C1	RE: Anyone lost a Golden Retriever  ??? I hope this dog has a family looking for him. Sadly in Dukhan we had had 2 retreivers dumped last week, they are very friendly and socialised and obviously used to belong to someone. This is exactly why I get sad by the changing fashions of dog breeds here, this time last year everyone wanted a Golden Retriever. Good luck, I hope you find his owners or a nice home for him.
Q342_C2	RE: Anyone lost a Golden Retriever  ??? Jasmine - that is so sad to hear. Why do people do this ? You are giving your dog a death sentence of slowing starving and dying in a cruel way. These dogs do not know how to fend for themselves.... The dog I found is about 10 years old and has been part of a family. How cold hearted must you be to just dump him and leave. I can not keep him for much longer as I have 4 cats who are so stressed out and living in my bedroom - it;s not fair on them.  I will keep him until after New Year incase his family has gone on vacation and the maid does not know where to look.  After that he will need to be re-homed. Not sure how to go about it but have already spoken to Kelly at QAWS. She is a star....

Q343	Wetsuits where can i find Yazbeck Wetsuits? is that brand available in qatar ??  thx a lot
Q343_C1	RE: Wetsuits LX so far the only shop where I have seen wetsuits is Go in Villagio Mall, but in the area nearby the Museum of Islamic Art there are two or three stores you might want to check because they sell marine stuff/goods.  Also going to Al Wakra there is one store for marine items. When going to AW from Doha, passing the first R/A on your right hand side there is a store for marine items.  Do you know where the Lufthansa offices are (Rayyan Complex) there you can find another store that sells maritime stuff.  Hope to be helpful!!  Regards!!

Q355_C7	RE: Qatari National Day is on a Friday, do we give a... The labour law clearly says Eid and Qatar National Day should be working day, so if the holiday falls on Friday this day should carry forward to next working day, if your company working on Saturday it should be Saturday, if Friday-Saturday off should be Sunday, unfortunately some companies are not following any rules which gets any benifits to employees, you work.. work... work... we earn when we feel you dont need simply go.. when you find any good job with better salary can say "No release". sponsorship law should be revised or you dont have any right as a human being, your life is controlled by a company or a sponsor??!!

Q363	Recommended Hotel or Apartment in Dubai? Hi, I plan to go Dubai with family (2 adults and 1 baby)for holiday on May. can anyone please recommend a good and reasonable price of hotel or apartment in Dubai? Preferably close to Emirates Mall.. Convenience. Budget about 200-400QR per night. Thank you.
Q363_C1	RE: Recommended Hotel or Apartment in Dubai? this might help you  http://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?sid=ab91593fd937507d6e68093121408810;class_interval=1;idf=1;offset=0;score_min=0;si=ai%2Cco%2Cci%2Cre%2Cdi;ss_all=0;;city=-782831;origin=disamb;srhash=2994667059;srpos=1
Q363_C2	RE: Recommended Hotel or Apartment in Dubai? Try Millenium airport hotel, it is 5 minutes from the airport and 500 meters from GIGICO metro station.  I paid around 400 Ryials per night for a double room through Expedia.com  The hotel is 4 stars with nice and spacious rooms and good service.  And one piece of advice, use the metro, it is cheap, reliable and will take you to all interest points including Emirates mall and Mall of Dubai.  Have a nice trip and let me know if you need other info
Q363_C3	RE: Recommended Hotel or Apartment in Dubai? That would be a 2-3 star hotel. MOE (Mall of Emirates)is accessible if you're going by Dubai Metro. I would suggest that you stay near Deira City (rather than on that area if you plan to stroll around). You'll have more access to malls like Deira City Center, Dubai Mall (near tall Burj Khalifa and the awesome water fountain)and Creek Park (Dolphinarium etc...) and not really far from the airport...  Suggestions that would fit your budget (That I know): Deira City Center Hotel, City Seasons Hotel, Ibis Deira City Center, Novotel Hotel.
Q363_C4	RE: Recommended Hotel or Apartment in Dubai? Thank you very much for your suggestion. Any other recommend area beside Deira? Can I drive in Dubai with Qatar Driving License?
Q364	Waqif Art Center closed? Heard a rumour that WAC has closed down.  Is it true?  Anyone know why?  Seems a shame to close down one of the very few places of culture to be found in Qatar. Perhaps they need the space for another coffee chain outlet.
Q364_C1	Dunno when. Seen it Dunno when. Seen it mentioned by two different sources over he last few days.  I only eat French KitKats now - Le ChitChat.

Q365	Starbucks in Doha I'm sure that Doha is like Dubai in the sense that there are bound to be a ton of Starbucks all over the place.  My question though.. is which one is the best for socializing?  Where I'm from in Texas the Starbucks I most frequented there was always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat.  Is there any place like that here... other than a bar.  Ryan
Q365_C1	Err, I'd be a little taken Err, I'd be a little taken aback if a man came up to me in a Doha Starbucks and started a random chat and I'm a Westerner! You need to go a little easy on that kind of thing here. Mandi
Q365_C2	What mandi said ^^Go on What mandi said ^^  Go on google/wiki and read up on middle eastern culture, or you going to get yourself into trouble.     If I was you i'd try to get involved with one of the local groups or go along to one of the bars. Groups like the hash house harriers are often a way to meet new people, talk to baldrick on here.
Q365_C3	lots of places to hang lots of places to hang around here were you could randomly sit down and have a chat.... . DESERT-an area of land, usually in very hot climates, that consists only of sand, gravel, or rock with little or no vegetation, no permanent bodies of water, and erratic rainfall. DESERT-a place or situation that is devoid of some desirable thing or overwhelmed by an undesirable thing. . http://www.qatar-info.com for addl info.
Q365_C4	Wow... youd be taken aback Wow... youd be taken aback if someone starting talking to you? Even if ti was something of the sort "What are you reading", " where are you from"  I'm not talking about plumping down in front of someone and starting up a conversation... its more like if one presented itself. like you over hear an accent... and your like.. hey where are you from?   Thats what I mean... if people in qatar cant handle that... i guess i have 3 things in store for me... a gym... a book... and xbox... though i admit dont have one, but if i cant be randomly social... video games seems the way to go... hahaha  ryan
Q365_C5	A lot of guys used to go to A lot of guys used to go to the one at Ramada signal to meet other guys...  Now they go to the Beanery.  Besides, Starbucks is so 2006.  No one goes anymore.
Q365_C6	Yeah Ryan, get yourself on Yeah Ryan, get yourself on the good ole HHH, we'll soon sort you out. Doha is to Dubai what Amish country is to Texas. If you are looking for sex on the beach then Dubai is for you (till you get nicked), but in small town Doha, strange things get noticed very quickly. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/" title="Monotone MIA by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpg" width="240" height="97" alt="Monotone MIA" /></a>
Q365_C7	Amish Country huh...  Well I Amish Country huh...  Well I dont think Texas has Amish... and if we did... they'd have big trucks... which would completely contradict their religion... and in that case would no longer be amish.  starbucks = 2006.... well 2006 was a good year... well maybe youre right... i just wikipediad 2006... nothing really that eventful popped out...  oh god... im so last year... what to do with myself  ryan
Q365_C8	Ryan Obliviously you are not gonna be the first Texan here.. you are in the right place.. Qatar living is the best place to socialize with like minded people...be active here..you will get to know people even  before coming here... Provided you behave good..lol  Talking to random people in starbucks is not a good idea..lol they might ask ...'why you wanna know what am reading'??

Q365_C10	Hangin' out Hey Ryan -  Welcome to Doha!!!!  Definately a big change from Texas.   The Starbucks thing is definately a bit out of it now.  Atleast here in Doha... coffee is still rockin' though so its an in-an-out thing...   Columbiano Coffee on CRing by Chili's is actually pretty decent.  I frequently plop myself down outside or on the nice comfy chairs and have coffee and a bit of lunch and internet surf... great in the evenings after gym anyway (Al Massa is right behind) or on Saturdays.    Ive struck up a few conversations here and there and ran into quite a few expats doing the same.   Good luck  Brin
Q365_C11	Welcome fellow Texan You will do great here.  People are reserved, but I've found if you smile and say hello, they will do the same. You may have to initiate the conversation, but many people will jump in if you start it. Trust me, the endless coffee shops are thriving everywhere, Starbucks, included.  Have a great adventure...it's what you make it.  Sybil  <img src="http://www.kandjsupplies.com/animations/pics/animal_camel.gif" />

Q365_C13	Speaking of gyms and pick up trucks I've been in a tiny rental car since ive been in dubai... and yesterday my company was like "we've got a big truck for you"   the truck they gave me was a toyota... I dont know about you all... but i dont think toyota knows the meaning of big... nor do my british colleagues that I work with.  A real truck is the kind in which you need a step latter to get into. hahaha  GYMs.... ok... because ive been working so much i have eaten an abundant amount of crap. ie mcdonalds, burger king, etc... i think ive eaten more fast food in the past month than i have in the past 2 years... anyway... are there any good gyms to work out at there?  by good.. i mean, im used to a 24 hour fitness type, in which the gym is huge... not a hotel fitness room.   On a personal note... I dont have a truck back home... I have dodge charger... and if i were to get a truckish type vehicle.. id go for a hummer... even though they are most likely going out of business   Ryan

Q365_C16	Only Americans smile in Doha Texas is a very friendly place.... 1st thing you notice is here nobody smiles except with their friends... People are not friendly and do not greet strangers with a smile and Hi; How are you!  People in this place have grim faces matching the dreary desert sand and oppressive heat and rough roads  Hey; Go to Industrial Area and you will have tons of fun :-) LOL
Q365_C17	ryan, you may noticed that a ryan, you may noticed that a lot of people don't smile. perhaps you will notice also that ladies don't smile at all.:) that's because of cultural differences , i think. back home we smile to strangers, but here if a woman smiles to a man, he thinks you like him and stalks you. arghhhh... oh, i know westerners don't behave that way but unfortunately, westereners are not the only ones populating doha. cheers!
Q365_C18	I don't know if you have I don't know if you have children Ryan from Texas but if you do and they say Please and Thank you they will be laughed at here in Qatar!

Q365_C19	whats all this thread whats all this thread about?? people not friendly in qatar? false they don't smile? false again they don't say plz and thank u? one more false thing they don't chat, speak, or talk to strangers? HELLO!!!
Q365_C20	Play nice:) Play nice:)
Q365_C21	FS i don't know what ur FS i don't know what ur talking about.. Ive lived here all my life and ppl always seem to be friendly i have never come across some guy being rude or obnoxious for no reason with me..

Q365_C22	Loathe as I am to make Loathe as I am to make generalization, I disagree Bahraini.  COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES, people are not as friendly to strangers in Qatar. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - they smile much less. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - people here are obnoxious, disrespectful to service staff in cafes, restaurants, shops, disrespectful of queues, non-smoking signs, use of mobile phones in cinames, and children here, particularly Arab kids, are the rudest little brats I've ever seen. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES - no, they are on the whole not friendly to strangers.  Try living in a western country and you'll see the difference.  People form orderly queues in traffic, at the movies, in shops, everywhere.  They don't smoke indoors.    They say please and thank you.
Q365_C23	Fubar--exactly Bahraini and others that think that this is a "friendly" and "respectable" place are NOT on the outside looking in....
Q365_C24	r7 There was no "cursing" in any of the responses on this thread.  You love Doha.  Some of us don't.  We should agree to disagree. That is the civilized and "friendly" thing to do. ;)

Q365_C26	I love STARBUCKS!! PM - Is Ramada Signal where the GMC garage is? And the Starbucks is next door to Johhny Rockets?  Ryan - If the answer to the above question is yes, then I would say this is a good place to start. I am from the UK and everytime we drive past that Starbucks its always fairly busy - no jam packed, but busy enough, and I always say to my husband "lets stop there for a coffee". We have gone there a couple of times and although I have only been here just over 2 weeks, I think it will be my new hangout. Just listen to conversations and you can pick out the english speakers from the none english speakers - although I havent noticed anyone reading books here yet, which is a shame...maybe me and you could start a trend! :)   In our old flat in the UK we used to have a Starbucks just a 5 minute walking distance away and I used to go there so regularly that I became pally with the staff and if I wasnt always in a rush, I would have probably made a few friends as well. I am like you, I always want to strike up a conversation with randoms because people interest me and I believe that you never know who you are going to meet.   At the end of the day, dont let this thread scare you off meeting people - ok, if they are wearing abayas, perhaps not, but I have found when you speak to people here, they are usually very friendly, more friendly than Dubai even! (I have never been to Texas so can't comment on that neck of the woods!)

Q379	Married couple coming for a visit Hi Everyone,  My friends who are both married to each other would like to visit me in Qatar. We were planning for them to stay with me. I am a single man with two bedrooms. Is it acceptable for them to stay in the other bedroom or would that be against Muslim laws?
Q379_C1	RE: Married couple coming for a visit You have'nt mention about your friends...are they muslims? I don't think so any one should have objection on it.. They are not only ur friends they r ur guest too so give them respect.
Q379_C2	RE: Married couple coming for a visit Kindly dont indulge every matter of life with Muslims.  why anyone here have objection to stay with you, if they have Visa & other legal formalities for Qatar.  Do you still think..............?
Q379_C3	RE: Married couple coming for a visit There is no law that prohibits you from entertaining a married couple. There is however always the possibility of some narrrow minded person making an objection. This would invariably be a fellow expat who wishes to make a statement in an attempt to draw attention to him/herself. 99.9% safe.

Q381	Need Expert Advice I have an impt question and need expert feedback.  If the last day of annual leave is immediately followed by 3 days of Eid holidays, Are these 3 days considered as part of annual leave?   In my company the HR Dept. calculates the 3 days as extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay.  Is this correct as per the law?  Experts pls guide.
Q381_C1	NO, its a public holiday. So NO, its a public holiday. So you have get paid for that.
Q381_C2	No Way.. Dont keep quiet. No Way.. Dont keep quiet. How can Eid holidays be Leave without Pay? Gift a copy of Qatar Labour Law to your HR department. If they still persist to cut your salary go and see the Labour Department officials...thy will help you.
Q381_C3	some people going vacation some people going vacation this September, trying to negotiate with the company to extend 3 days from their planned vacation. for example they were supposed to start vacation by Sept 10 and comeback by Oct. 10 (1 month vacation) and the eid holidays will be from 21-24, they usually come back by Oct. 13. something like that.
Q381_C4	Labour law : Article (78) The worker shall be entitled to annually,   leave with full wage as   follows:  1.Three working days for Eid EI-Fitr 2.Three working days for Eid Al-Adha 3.One working day for the Independence day 4. Three working days to be specified by the employer.
Q381_C5	Not all companies fall under Not all companies fall under the labour law troll, you work in the ministry you should know that.   QP, RasGas, Al Jazeera etc and the rest of the government are not governed by the labour law, they are governed by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor.   If you are on leave during a holiday, that day is counted as your annual leave. If you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the Eid holiday then it will not be counted as annual leave. Same goes for maternity leave. Annual leave is paid leave and an public holidays that fall within it are not counted as extra days unless your company has specific policy in this regard.   ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q382_C2	RE: Turkey/Istanbul Travel Satheesh 44983527 / 8 Millennium Travel   IATA  &  ISO certified The Pearl  millennium@cdc-qatar.com
Q382_C3	RE: Turkey/Istanbul Travel No need for a travel agent for tours. Just book the cheapest flight and go directly to Sultanamet in Istanbul. All the sights are conveniently located in that area and there are dozens of hotels that you can chose there and then. We just used the map and walked everywhere!!! Yeh we didnt need to waste money on taxis or othe transport. Let me warn you that mid June and Jult gets very hot and humid but the monuments are certainly worth it. We even walked to the Bosporous from our hotel (Hotel Ambassador) and bought the ticket there and then, for the boat ride so no need to spend extra by buying the ticket from a tour operator. Istanbul is beautiful and the kids and i loved it. Cant wait to go back.
Q382_C4	RE: Turkey/Istanbul Travel Lamea has given you excellent advise. We had a lovely trip 2 years back. All major attractions are walking distance in Sultan Ahmet. We spent 3 days in Istanbul, then took a tour from one of the local tour operators and spent 12 days exploring Cappadokia, Pammukale, Kusa desi, Troy etc. It was great ... we learnt a lot about history, did a lot of trekking, me, my wife & 3 kids loved the tour. The 12 days trip costed me 1000 euros and about 500 in istanbul. Call me if u need more info ... Cheers  Zak (6646-8056)
Q382_C5	RE: Turkey/Istanbul Travel Wow.. Thank you everyone. Yes, actually my plan is to travel and explore Istanbul by ourself and get a local tour for trip to Cappadocia and Pamukkale. Or is it a good idea to travel to Cappadocia and Pamukkale without tour guide as well?? We will be travel to Turkey on end of September. I believe the weather is nice on that month.
Q382_C6	RE: Turkey/Istanbul Travel Turkey is a mountain country, so travel by train and coach is slow ... i bought the package from a local tour operator in istanbul (sultan Ahmet area). All tour operators give u the same package i.e. the hotel accomo is same ... but the ones on the main street are twice expensive compared to the ones in side streets. We took a luxury coach from istanbul at night and arrived early morning in capadokia... then took coach to pammukale (6hrs)... It was comfortable and pleasant ... you can research about turkey on the internet. You dont need a translator... the tour operator will give u the itinerary for your trip and when u arrive at hotel they tour guide will collect you and they speak good english. When u are in capadokia PLEASE take the Hot air Baloon Safari... its a great experience to see the chimneys from above ... leave the kids in the hotel because its expensive. Cheers

Q384_C2	"Why is smoking bad for you"? "Smoking is responsible for several diseases, such as cancer, long-term (chronic) respiratory diseases, and heart disease, as well as premature death. Over 440,000 people in the USA and 100,000 in the UK die because of smoking each year. According the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), $92 billion are lost each year from lost productivity resulting from smoking-related deaths.  Of the more than 2.4 million deaths in the USA annually, over 440,000 are caused by smoking.  Smoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the world. Recent studies have found that smokers can undermine the health of non-smokers in some environments". Source: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10566.php

Q385_C3	RE: What is the meaning of this trafic fine? it's a wrong parking, trust me. I think their system generates reasons IN ENGLISH randomly, without any order. If you can check the Arabic version, you will see what does it mean. And again, i am pretty sure, it's a penalty for the wrong Parking . Just go and pay it.

Q390	Signs of Autism I have a 2.5 years old son with a delay in speech.  I wonder this is a sign of autism. Is there a doctor in doha who can help me.    Please help me.
Q390_C1	go to hmc you better go to hmc opd they will give u an appointment to pediatrician, then dr will refer u to rumailla. in rumailla they will help u by giving speech therophy for ur child. dont worry here in hmc they will help u a alot. hope ur son will talk soon...
Q390_C2	Signs of Autism Speech delay alone is not a sign of autism. There are other signs. I would highly recommend that you go to Shafalllah Centre for an assessment, and if he is diagnosed there as autistic or just speech delay, you can go to Qatar Autism Centre for private one-to-one sessions, but this depends on your budget, Rumaila's problem is that they have very busy schedules and they give you only one session per week and they depend on the parents to continue at home but they are supported by Hamad so you do not pay a lot for this session.   But in Qatar Autism Centre, it is not supported but they can give you up to 3 times a week and during the evening and not during working hours as in Rumaila!  Good Luck!
Q390_C3	Thanks all for your support. Thanks all for your support.

Q394_C16	Okay so I asked a pharmacy Okay so I asked a pharmacy and sure enough they do do ear piercings. I didn't ask if they pierce bigger than 16G though, I would have asked but she didn't sound like she spoke very good english and me and my family we're on there way out of the mall. So does anyone know if any pharmacies do larger than average piercings?   Thanks~

Q395	Planning to ship UK Right Hand Drive car I'm planning on shipping (or driving over) my RHD UK car to Qatar for the duration of my contract.  I'll be taking it back to UK at the end of the contract.   The car is only 2 years old.  What are the procedures to do this?   Whom should I contact? I sent an email to the MOI over a week ago, but I'm yet to get a response back.  I'm in Doha now so please advice me where I can go to arrange this.  Regards,  ys
Q395_C1	Somebody brought the Knight Rider Pontiac car around here ...so it's possible, musashi.  "Everything in this book may be wrong." Illusions: The Adventures of The Reluctant Messiah by Richard Bach
Q395_C2	Driving is the least of my problems I've spent the last year driving the car (Right Hand Drive UK spec) in Holland, Germany (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwTTRCgIX58), France and Italy (which are all left hand drive countries); so sitting on the wrong side is the least of my problems - it is damned easy. I've already started driving in Doha (in a crappy company car) and the driving here is easy, too.   As to whether or not the spec of the car is suitable to be driven in Qatar without modifications to AC etc, I shall find out when I call Mercedes, tomorrow. I know that a lot of the specs are above GCC specs (i.e. emissions, airbags, safety rating etc).  However, if bringing the car over is simply a legal impossibility, then I'll save my time. <b>That</b> is the purpose of my question.   So, I ask again; can I bring it over, and if so, how?  Given the credit crunch, it is impossible to sell for a reasonable return, so I'd rather keep it out here.  Thanks

Q395_C4	Will the paintwork of a UK Will the paintwork of a UK car be up to the rigours of life in the desert? I thought cars for the Qatar market had special treatment to protect them from the abrasive sand.
Q395_C5	I am glad you think I am glad you think everything is so easy, I personally find driving here a bit more difficult than London. I guess I am just thick. Seeing as you are finding everything so easy, go to the Ministry and ask them if you can do it. That's what I did.
Q395_C6	Can the car be imported, or not? I thought the question was pretty straight forward.  Indeed, I shall make all the necessary inquiries regarding the car's spec, before making my final decision.   However, at this time, all I want to know is if it is <b>possible</b> to do it.  A simple <b>Yes</b> or <b>N</b>o would do. If yes, then the appropriate measures to do so would be a nice addition.  Beyond that, whether I wish to risk <i>my</i> car's paint work, rubber, plastic, AC etc will be a decision that I'll take later.  Thanks

Q395_C9	Can you import a car or not? :) I may be moving to Quatar in May 2009.  I have the same questions as Shaunconnor and Musashi:  1.- Can you import a car to Quatar or not? 2.- What is involved? Is it a headache not work taking on or can it be done? 3.- What import duty, if any, applies?  My car is a right-hand drive bmw and I am considering bringing it simply because I like driving it.   I don't think heat or sand will be a problem, given that the car has been at home in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.

Q399_C3	Bahraini :) Locating the Best model ! This can be arduous and many have to be tested before the final choosing of the "best" one-however once decided upon, their performance can rapidly decline to an unacceptable level.

Q399_C4	uk .. are english any uk .. are english any better?
Q399_C5	Bahraini-its a World wide problem!! I have been 2 many places and seen and tried many milkshaking machines and they all work wonderfully whilst shiny and new.  They soon drop in performance, and this is not anything to do with the manufacturing country!  The only way to prevent this is to be able to afford many different models and use them infrequently to prevent wear!!

Q399_C7	There are actual Milkshake There are actual Milkshake blenders but these are not practical as all you can do is..... well, make milkshakes.   You are much better off with a hand blender. They have a deep measured glass you can make milkshakes, smoothies etc in, and if you want you can also use it to blend soups and such. There is a very nice moulinex one that has attachements for chopping and grinding but it runs about 600+Qr, but very handy.

Q400_C2	RE: problem skin Go to the pharmacist and ask about Retin-A gel/cream.
Q400_C3	RE: problem skin hi! i have break outs a few months back, no doubt exacerbated by the weather, dust and food here. before, i used to have few pimples but it was hormonal (i only have pimples after college already)so my ob-gyn prescribed a low dose birth control pills for me (diane). it worked actually but since i don't want to be under medication on anything for a long time, i stopped taking the meds. i tried lots of over the counter products but not all of them worked as advertised. now,i'm using st. ive's facial scrub (gentle), followed by an exfolliant/ lightening product (extraderm-a filipino product) then moisturizer (olay complete). thank fully, the break outs subsided. i guess, you have to use gentle products and stick with them if you are okay with them.(i have used clearasil before but it is not effective on my skin) then stay away from fried food esp. chicken and dusty places. i had a major breakout when i was still living in gharaffa which is very, very dusty.   if you want first aid (when you have to go on dates or impt. functions) do these steps: 1. clean face 2. put ice on the pimple for about 10-20 mins. this will lessen the swelling. 3. dip a piece of cotton on fresh lemon juice then placed it atop the pimple for about 5 mins. this will lessen the redness.  feel free to pm me if you have further questions..
Q400_C4	RE: problem skin Hi  Kindly avoid Chocolates, oily foods & wash face with normal water.(Not cholrinated)Store water for 1 hour and use it. You feel better and confident in two months of time  Neethu
Q400_C5	RE: problem skin Thanks guys, your advice is taken and compliments of the season to you all.
Q400_C6	RE: problem skin Rein A is effective but first you have to find something to peel the outer part of your skin...this will make any over the counter cream effective. Maxi peel is used for at least a month but avoid sun while using, better yet use only at night, and lots of moisturizers and sunblock in the day. Peeling of the skin is good so as to take out all old skin where dirt hides and and when infection occurs, it freaks out there the pimples cause. But after few weeks of peeling, you can then proceed to retin- A for complete medication. Chocolates or sweets or fries is not really the cause, but makes the pimples big it triggers to be big, itchy, red,and swell. Avoid spicy too, drinking citrus juice helps to shrink them. If this pimples really big and all over your face and even at your back, better consult the doctor to take medicine intake, i forgot the name, but i will get back to you soon i remember
Q400_C7	RE: problem skin Is retin-A (tretinoin) available over the counter in Qatar? It's also a good anti-wrinkle cream.
Q401	Exit.............GCC...........! My friend was in Saudi Arabia for the one year. Now under vacation in Sri Lanka. But he is not interested in going back to Saudi due to some problems with employer. I think as per the rule he will be getting EXIT and cant go back to Saudi for next two years to work under another employer. Can he apply immediately for another GCC country or the Saudi EXIT will effect all GCC countries.
Q401_C1	If he is not blacklisted by If he is not blacklisted by saudi , he can apply
Q401_C2	He is not allowed 'dual GCC He is not allowed 'dual GCC residency'. If he doesn't cancel his Saudi visa it will automatically expire 6 months after his departure and then the ban time starts. If his visa is cancelled by his employer it goes straight into ban period (however long that is in Saudi).   Suggestion? Get a new passport to reenter another GCC Country. Have met many people during my stay in Qatar who have done the same.
Q401_C3	I had a couple of guys in our I had a couple of guys in our company who were banned (not only cancelled) in UAE and they got their Qatari work visa with the same passport. Only in some specific cases, the ban is imposed in all the GCC...not in all.  As far as the dual GCC residency is concerned..... I dont know about all the GCC but Qatar allows you to keep both by paying a fee of QR 2000/year. The information is available on the MoI's website.
Q401_C4	I doubt.......let him try his I doubt.......let him try his LUCK!
Q401_C5	He can apply to another He can apply to another country in GCC if his Saudi visa is cancelled.
Q401_C6	That's why That is why they called it GCC, entire region of gulf countries. He can apply to any GCC country except saudi with his new passport. Otherwise, NOC is a requirement.
Q401_C7	There might be a 6 month There might be a 6 month period where he is banned in the GCC overall, but the 2 year is only applicable in the individual GCC Country.
Q401_C8	No ban in GCC, only in KSA. No ban in GCC, only in KSA. He can still work in any other GCC, irrespective of the ban in KSA!
Q401_C9	He can apply for other GCC He can apply for other GCC countries.

Q403	Watch England V West Indies Hey guys  is there anywhere (preferably where I can have a beer!) I can watch the England v West Indies cricket game?  I was thinking Champions in the Marriott but its not actually a very nice bar in my opinion.  Any other hotels or one of the few licensed bars?   Cheers
Q403_C1	Thanks Luciano!I must admit, Thanks Luciano!  I must admit, I didn't make it to the Ramada and did (sadly) end up in Champions.  The big problem with Champions was the lack of sound as I like hearing the commentary.  Are we able to hear the commentary in Ramada?  If not then I guess I will watch it in my hotel room.  I won't be able to have a beer but I will at least really enjoy the cricket.
Q403_C2	Yeah that's what I'll do in Yeah that's what I'll do in the short term when in the company's hotel apartment (got sky player so can watch most things live then). Would rather have all the sports channels when I get my only place
Q403_C3	Which hotel?  Movenpick Which hotel?  Movenpick Towers is too slow to run anything useful.  Just about get away with TVCatchup but forget iPlayer, 4OD, Sky Go/Player... need too much bandwidth. :(
Q403_C4	I'll be staying in the Asas I'll be staying in the Asas Twin Towers Apartments in West Bay. Obviously I've not idea what they have there! If the internet is too slow then it'll have to be the pub for any sport until I sort my own place out when the wife comes over at the end of summer.
Q403_C5	OK, so you shouldn't be too OK, so you shouldn't be too far from the Marriott then which will at the very least, cover the usual selection of sports.  Failing that, you also have the option of the Ramada but that's a bit further out of town (5 each way in a cab).  I personally am not a big fan of Champions (the Marriott) but I will if I have to.  Also, as these pubs show many different sports they rarely put the sound on.... although they did for the footy the other night.  Of course, another option would be to go sit in champions with your laptop, stick your headphoness, tag on to the free wifi, fire up the VPN and order a beer... ;)
Q403_C6	Ok thanks for the advice! Ok thanks for the advice! I'll be looking for somewhere decent to go for the Euros, especially the England games. Will be over after our first game.  Once I get my permanent place I'll sort out my sports based TV package!

Q405_C1	RE: Can I Get a car(old or new)for rental for less than... the cheapest rate we had the last time we rented a car was for Qr60 per day, Honda Civic 2005. Go to Bin Omran, there's a corner there after Badriya signal with lots of car rental services and I think you can bargain for a lower rate if you will rent for a month or more.

Q406_C2	Depends entirely on your Depends entirely on your position and where you are coming from.  The day typically starts much much earlier than in Europe and somewhat earlier than the U.S., but it also finishes earlier.
Q406_C3	Pace is slow, work pressure Pace is slow, work pressure has to be less than anywhere else in the world.  Working hours vary but unless he is working for a contracting company he will be free by 5 at max so your husband will have plenty of time for the family here.
Q406_C4	qatarisun "By 2:31 the office looked completely dead."? lollll
Q406_C5	The problem with finance is The problem with finance is that people are often expected to work Fridays, because the rest of the financial world is still operating.  This often means only a one-day weekend, particularly people working in the international sectors.
Q406_C6	Sa165, i  am not sure what is Sa165, i  am not sure what is easier, to find a job when you come with your spouse or when you come alone.. I think these two are irrelevant and have nothing to with each other.  As for "to come or not to come", it obviously depends on your hub's salary. Depends on what you are giving up...
Q406_C7	Thanks all for your answers Thanks all for your answers :-))
Q406_C8	we Mohammed good to know ;-) we are planning to flight together, we are waiting for his work permit and we were assuming I can automatically go there. Tks for clarifying.
Q406_C9	sa165 You could fly together, but it would depend on your husband's company in terms of what arrangements they could make for you. You would have to come in on a Tourist or Business Visa. The latter is more convenient and will be valid for 3 months (although will have to be renewed once a month). During this time, your husband's papers should be sorted out, and he can then sponsor you as his family. Your Business Visa would get converted. You could find work with your new Residents' Visa. This is more advisable because once you are sponsored by your husband, you can take up or quit jobs like in the 'normal' world. Should you come here sponsored by a company, you're stuck with them, no matter how badly things might go. And if you quit, you'd have to leave the country and not come back for 2 years. It all sucks, but that's how it is :-/
Q406_C10	chocaholic, this is really chocaholic, this is really helpful and covers everything :-) thanks a lot!!
Q406_C11	Sa, don't ask your company Sa, don't ask your company for business visa , it is  an incompliance issue, you r not eligible for business visa. Whoever advise you to do so, advise you to violate the law. Also company might not like it at all. You as a Canadian can get visa upon arrival at Doha airport, which is valid for 1 month and extendable for another month. Once your hubs RP is finalized, he can sponsor you ( check this point with his company prior to traveling!) . As for changing a job, there are certain rules with regards to this matter. You as sponsored by you hub can quit/change the job any time. He can not change his sponsor any earlier than 1 (sometimes 2) year/s. If he got so-called no objection certificate (NOC), he can change the company with no problem. Ask him to check with his company whether  providing a NOC is in their policy or not. If no NOC is granted, he has to leave the country for 2 years.
Q406_C12	Qatarisun It is the companies themselves (both in my case and in that of several others that I know) that advise the Business Visa.  But if Tourist Visa works as well for her, then it's for the company to advise so.  The Business Visa is renewable for up to 3 months and if needed, one can do a 'Visa run' out of Qatar and come back to get another Business Visa valid for yet another 3 months.  This makes it all much easier, because there's no telling how long things take to get done here. Especially with her husband's RP. My friend's took 3 months.
Q406_C13	sa165 As far as leaving the company goes, like Qatarisun said, this depends on the NOC. Usually, it is safe to assume that you would have to leave the country - or this is what I have heard from most people.  In any case, getting an NOC is NOT something to depend on, as you would never know until you're actually at that stage.  If you have a family here, you wouldn't really want to be coerced to leave and not come back, would you?  It really is best to wait to be sponsored by your husband. It takes a little patience and time, I know, but in the middle and long run, it's a way better bet, all things considered.  You must check with his company about how long before he can sponsor you - from what I understand, that varies with nationality and level of seniority. I know someone who was asked to wait 6 months before he could sponsor his wife - apparently Qatar's 'probation' period :)   Anyway, for starters, get in here together on tourist/Business Visas (let the company HR advise on and handle that...every company has different degrees of weight they can pull :)), look around, settle down and wait till your husband can sponsor you.  Good luck!

Q410	Salad Chopper Hi, Just happened to read on msn health that one of the 14 kitchen gadgets required for any " healthy kitchen" is the Good Grips Salad Chopper with bowl. Does any one know if this is available in Doha - if so where ? WE do so love salad at home but are often deterred by not being able to chop the leaves into teeny weeny bits.  AP
Q410_C1	Aunt Canned food might include many preservatives, additives, flavors, colorings. Most are not natural products. Rather artificial. I am talking about the Eeeee's family.  I am not sure if there are any studies in this regard. But there are warnings about additives. Check the ingredients and do some research about the E-family. Here is a link to start with http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm  In my opinion. A nice presentation has nothing to do with the way you prepare food. For example salad is usually a cocktail of vegetables, possibly some fruits, possibly cheese and ham. You can simply mamage a nice decoration for the top part and forget about the lower part.  If you watch how Jamie Oliver prepares the food, you will be amazed. In no time he can prepare food and arrange a table with a nice variety and it looks yummy ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

Q410_C4	What a kitchen arsenal :D All you need guys is a good knife and chopping board.  Regarding tabboule. Nothing will do but chopping the parsley by hand (knife/board). Even if you manage to chop the parsley , you are stuck with cutting the tomatoes. They have to be cut into 5 to 10mm cubes.  My information about healthy salad, is to chop the green leaves and herbs by hand (no knife)  The funny thing when they say "This gadget strips lemons and oranges of their outermost peels, which contain limonene, a compound that may decrease cancer risk." and somewhere else thay talk about a can opener. When cans are involved, cancer is there.   ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409
Q410_C5	I dont think you will find I dont think you will find it, but there is a herb chopper here. It is basically a rounded 2 blade knife which is rocked back and forth over the leaves to make them this way. You should be able to find it in Lulu quite easily, or any supermarket for that matter.   ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

HMC dares to publish a survey showing how many of their top staff, or their families, actually use the service of HMC.
Q412_C4	JCi is a very good JCi is a very good accrediting body which provides correct tools and solutions to any healthcare  organization. Proper or Actual use of those tools rests at the hands of the staff.   1. Implementation is such a different issue. that depends on the staffs' intellect, willingness to adapt new processes, as well as their genuine service, not to mention that they should have real educations, not fake ones.
Q412_C5	Excellent JCI is directing all departments for the right procedures and policies.to be honest if JCI is not visiting, there are enough staff just neglecting their work. that can be seen just before jci visit, their running everywhere. don't know what to do.coz they were not working.if we do daily updates and follow procedures ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibilities, we don't have to scared of jci.what i noticed so many departments,heads are panic and updating everything only just before jci visit. i am really happy to have jci visit every month.

Q418_C2	RE: Where can I get International Driving License I am... Contact Shyam -5812994, QR:150/-
Q418_C3	RE: Where can I get International Driving License I am... First the international Driving License is not a Driving License, Just a translation of your DL in several languages and should be provided by an official authority not by any web-based agency. Second, this does not replace your DL, and you have to keep both documents with you. Third, the Qatar DL is NOT recognised in many countries, I just checked in France and Belgium and this is not the case at the moment. So check before for every country you plan to visit, since in several countries you will not be allowed to drive.  Generally speaking it seems that it works with reciprocity, nationalities that have to pass the driving test here come from countries that do not recognize the Qatari driving license. This might chance since it seems that obtaining the DL here is getting harder.

Q423	Where can you find homeopathy remedies? Anyone has some ideas in Doha? Thanks
Q423_C1	State of Qatar doesn't allow State of Qatar doesn't allow practice of Homeopathy, tough luck.
Q423_C2	That might not be the case That might not be the case flexicode. From what I've heard there are places here that do provide forms of natural/alternative medicine, which they call here 'ilaaj tabee-ee'.  I know that the Boots store in uk stock homeopathic remedies but I'm not quite sure about the Boots here, but its still worth continuing to ask around or when in doubt call up 180 and ask if they have any numbers for places that practice natural medicine or homeopathy.
Q423_C3	uk_qtr, the practice of uk_qtr, the practice of homeopathy is prohibited here by law, but if somebody is practicing it under a different name, I don't know. However I will be happy to find a good homeopathy practitioner in Qatar myself. Lets find it and whosoever comes across one, will inform the other. I will be working on your 'ilaaj tabee-ee' clue.:)
Q423_C4	Thanks guys, well actually, Thanks guys, well actually, cant understand why its forbidden in Qatar, I need homeopathic remedies for myself and my allergies, otherwise I would have to take commercial medicines which are heavy in side effects. Homeopathy is just great, a little plant can make miracles. If you do find out, please post it on the forum again. Thanks -

Q426	What is considered a good package What is considered a good package in Qatar?  I was approaced by a company, they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport.  Is this good, bad ..... or just okay?
Q426_C1	I have to add that they I have to add that they provide accommodation. Not an allowance.
Q426_C2	I think it's small for a I think it's small
Q426_C3	that is more or less that is more or less QAR6.5K. i think that's a bit low, but if they pay for your accom and schooling for your kids (your two biggest expenses),you could be making some saving...maybe just get them to specify the nature of the perks; i.e. accom=flat or villa, transport= ?. also, do they provide you with return tickets per year for you and your family? hope this helps.
Q426_C4	I also LOL Dracula!!!   I also thought it was a bit low. I'm now on almost tripple that in my country, but offcourse not have any ohter benefits.   Thanks Dukes. I will ask them to send me a more detailed breakdown of what they're offering.  But overall, I think I need to negotiate for a bigger basic.
Q426_C5	"What is considered a good "What is considered a good package"   Euhmm....   I think above 16 CM is considered a "good package".
Q426_C6	*sigh* x 10000! Come on people, I'm actually quite serious.  I do find (some) of your comments funny, but I would like to get a clear/honest answer.   Please.  Are there only males on this site ..... huh?

"  Nearly two-third of Qatar's population consists of males, reflecting a very low female sex ratio overall. Like other Gulf countries this fact can be attributed to the presence of higher number of expatriate male workers' population living as singles.  The female sex ratio on the contrary is low to very low in old Doha area and in the out side urban areas. Exceptionally, the industrial area of Zone 57 has just 3 females per 1000 of males. This spatial variation in sex ratio explains some of the obvious characteristics of population distribution in the country."</b>  http://www.gisqatar.org.qa/alkhabar/Spring99/census.html . .  <a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/29658m.jpg" border="0" alt="I
Q426_C8	Any suggestions of where I Any suggestions of where I can get an answer to my original question?   LOL ...... or if there's any female out there (from the same planet), that does understand my question (which was in clear English), please answer me!  Hehehehe.  Grrrrrr!
Q426_C9	Prada The only way to determine if it's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save. That's what the majority of people are in Qatar for....to save. It's difficult to fix on a salary as there are so many extras (as others have mentioned) such as education allowance for kids, housing, transport, possibly a furnishing grant etc.
Q426_C10	Package is fine in Prada,   Package is fine in itself, it combines all major costs, hence you will be able to set aside little.   But you will not be living like a king.  If your salary back home is equal, stay away. If this is a major improvement ... why not.
Q426_C11	Thanks for the replies .... Thanks for the replies .... now we're getting somewhere hehe.  We're a family of three. They will also cover schooling, which is great, since we have a 2 yr old.   I think it's okay, since they will cover all major costs.  At the moment, we're looking at saving about 2000QAR. DH will also have to find a job once we are there.    I have requested a detailed breakdown of all the extra's they will be covering, so I'm waiting to hear back from them. If they cover all major expenses (housing, schooling, transport, relocation, medical) ... 6400QAR + DH's salary are not to bad (I think).
Q426_C12	Prada, do NOT come for less Prada, do NOT come for less than you are making in the US. The standard recruitment package for Americans is your current salary plus 25% overseas benefit plus housing, transportation, tickets, medical and schooling for up to three children. You're being low-balled, honey, negotiate for more! You won't have the chance later, believe me. Mandi
Q426_C13	PS, Prada, is your hubby's PS, Prada, is your hubby's nationality US? There can be some issues with your sponsoring a husband while he is working. You need to check this out as well. Mandi

Q427	Studio Apartments in West Bay Towers Can anyone tell me the price range of studio apartments in towers in West Bay cost? I'm going to start working in one of them and would like to live near work if possible.
Q427_C1	In west bay? Or at West Bay In west bay? Or at West Bay Towers?  You will be looking at 7500 QAR per month and upwards. However Ezdan has cheap accomodation in west bay - 3500 pm on a long term contract.
Q427_C2	Thanks Thanks Azamat. I'm looking for accommodation at any one of the towers in West Bay. QR3500 is a pretty good price. What are the tradeoffs?
Q427_C3	it's a one year contract. i it's a one year contract. i think the 3500 apartment doesn't have a kitchen. the ones with a kitchen costs almost double. 6500 i think
Q427_C4	The tradeoffs? Other than The tradeoffs? Other than what Wirehead mentioned above - Living in Ezdan will remind you of prison cells in Shawshank Redemption. Not to mention, Ezdan has the worst fire safety record in Qatar.
Q427_C5	Without a kitchen? How is it Without a kitchen? How is it an apartment without a kitchen? Mandi
Q427_C6	that's what the guy i talked that's what the guy i talked to said when i asked about the rates in ezdan. probably more like a hotel room instead of an apartment?
Q427_C7	Mandi, originally Ezdan was Mandi, originally Ezdan was built as a Hotel, then they re-built it as residential appartements.. I guess they left few smallest appartments without the kitchen as a hotel room.. the layout of the flats sucks (some flats built in a way that you have to cross the bedroom to get into the kitchen), quality sucks, and it's already feels old and stinky... Since they rent out some apartments for the short term like a hotel, you can imagine what's going in the lobby every day...people with the luggage, coming, leaving..   Quite depressing place. I could recommend it as a temporary accommodation in the West Bay for those who just came in Qatar, has a workplace in West bay and is intending to look for the place to live at the same area..

Q429	Qatar Airways Upgrades: Who has the power? I've always wondered who at Qatar Airways would have the authority to upgrade you.  In the EU and US the gate agents themselves have some lenience.  Could your check-in agent upgrade you or would they need clearance?  Anyone work for QR or has any insight?
Q429_C1	I always do that, decently I always do that, decently attractive guy, fit.  Always dress nice but no dice....I just think QA works differently as far as upgrades as most other airlines.  Maybe 500qr in my Passport may help...LOL

Malaysia is a very nice place to visit. its also safe & very good specially with your family.

Q443	whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for a infant?? Mums please suggest...........
Q443_C1	RE: whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for... it varies no 2 babies are alike.  You need to ask your doctor and trust your instincts as a mother.
Q443_C2	RE: whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for... Dear lauraferns,  I'd suggest you to watch your baby's growth closely and at some time around 4-6 months , you may notice that your baby is not getting enough from your milk. ( This is purely subjective but you are the best person to make the decision). At this stage, you can start a little (spoonfuls ) of rice water, egg yolk, a few squirts of orange juice etc.., in the beginning and if you find that everything is going well , then you can introduce some more new items- one a week or so. Gradually you will find that your baby is enjoying all these new foods. Remember to keep up with the breast milk as long as possible along with these weaning foods.  If you would like to include cereal , you could do that too. By 1 year of age the infant should have had a taste of everything you ever want him/her to. I would advise you not to add sugar or salt additionally in any food item because you may be introducing an unwanted habit for life. Good luck with the weaning. AP
Q443_C3	RE: whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for... No 2 babies are alike.Check with your doctor.  I started semi solid for my kid after 6 months and solids after a year..
Q443_C4	RE: whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for... From what I've been told and have read... it's best to wait until six months for most babies (always check with the baby's doctor).  This is a great website that I used often for food recommendations for babies: http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/ They also have great information on what foods to avoid until the baby is older.  Good eating to you baby!
Q443_C5	RE: whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for... Best age to introduce semi solids is when the baby is 6 months old.  Do not introduce salt and sugar to baby's meals untill he/ she is 1 year.

Q445	Is there anyway around NOC? Is there anyway to avoid the requirement of a NOC if you want to change a job and your employer does not want to give you a NOC?
Q445_C1	RE: Is there anyway around NOC? For what I have read in the site, yes there is a way.  Since your current sponsor/employer does not want to give release/NOC then move back to your country, wait for 2 years and then come back.  Sorry but if you can not get NOC then the most likely situation is for you to go back home.  Regards!!
Q445_C2	RE: Is there anyway around NOC? If they didn't give you a NOC the only way is to go back.. but when your old company and the new company have same sponsor, then the new company can ask for the NOC and hire you and you dont have to wait for 2 years!
Q445_C3	RE: Is there anyway around NOC? this may be- if your employer dont have work and not giving you salary human right commission helps some times, but dont ask me where are they?

Q449	petrol stations on way to uae i would like to travel to uae this eid viaroad. do any body know wether there are sufficiant petrol pumps at the border. how many pumps are there during transit in saudiarabia?  thank u in advance
Q449_C1	OK here is my advice. fill in OK here is my advice. fill in Qatar before you leave then fill up again just when you are leaving the Saudi Boarder, this will be the Saudi side before the UAE boarder. This should be enough for to get to Abu Dhabi or even Dubai.  Because if you miss this Petrol Station then the next station within in UAE is atleast 100km. This is from my experience of 2007, I dont know if they have built any more Petrol Station since then.  Also a small factor to consider is that Petrol in Qatar and Saudi is cheaper than UAE.  Have a safe trip.
Q449_C2	there are many petrol there are many petrol stations from UAE-KSA border to Abu Dhabi
Q449_C3	There is a petrol station There is a petrol station less than a kilometer after going thru the saudi border from qatar (right side). There is another one a few kilometers before exiting saudi to the UAE (left side).  There is a petrol station a few kilometers after passing thru the UAE border (right side). This is the last petrol station along the highway before reaching abu dhabi proper.  Keep in mind the petrol price in UAE is 3x compared to saudi.  I hope this helps. Have safe trip.

Q451	Is police clearance required for all transfers of sponsorship? I have recently switched to a new job and sponsor in Qatar. I am now being told that I need to produce a Police Clearance certificate from my home country, before I can get the transfer of sponsorship.  When I came for my first job in Qatar, 3 years ago, I was never asked to produce a Police Clearance.  Would appreciate any clarification on the rules regarding this. Thanks.
Q451_C1	RE: Is police clearance required for all transfers of... A Police Clearance Certificate (PCC)from your country of citizenship is mandatory during sponsorship transfer.  At the Indian embassy, the PCC (for Indian Nationals) will be issued within 2 days. Need to fill up the form and 2 photos and around 80 QR.  This PCC then needs to be stamped at the Ministry of Consulate Affairs (this is the same MOFA but they've shifted and renamed this section, the building is on your right when traveling from Munthaza signal (Radwat Khalil intersection) to Gulf Cinema signals.  This document then needs to be submitted to your new sponsor, they will get a medical date for you (yes, it needs to be done, even if you've done it before for the previous employer).  When the medical result and PCC is submitted to the CID, you'll go for fingerprinting and then in 2 weeks CID will either approve or deny the sponsorship change. If the sponsorship change is approved, they will give you / your sponsor your Qatar PCC. End of procedure. Enjoy new job :-)

Q452_C2	There is a Leelah,  There is a substantial difference between "Whole Wheat" and "100% Whole Wheat". The first is bread made of a mix which includes some (usually low quantity) of whole wheat.  In Carrefour and local bakeries, you can only find "whole wheat bread"!

Q456_C6	We reached Cornish at 6 PM. We reached Cornish at 6 PM. Nothing except huge crowed. They put 3 TV and there was nothing to show. All the time showing sea, some dead man, old houses, fire etc. At least they should have broadcasted morning event or some dignitaries meeting and wishing other dignitaries. Only entertainment was that an old gentle man was asked by police to move away from some area as it was for the family but that man refused to move and there was long argument. The man flatly refused stating that where it is written reserved for the family" He also called 2 ladies and asked if they have any problem if he sits here. Ladies told No, He then asked police that if ladies have no problem then what your problem is. You being a man, you should also move and keep lady police in family zone. The police man got fed up and left the place but police man was good and never lost tamper.   Realized that quarrel or argument can also be entertaining and good times pass. Even some helicopter was flying; every one was looking at that. Overall it was not very exciting, just watching crowed and children. Fire cracker show at 8 PM was fantastic. It was worth watching.

Q456_C18	Did you enjoy the fireworks? Did we murder Mother Earth good? Now that the festivities are over I'd like to point you in the direction of this article from the Los Angeles Times ( http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fireworks4-2008jul04,0,245124,full.story )that discusses how awful for the environment fireworks are. Turns out the answer is "really bad." In fact, concentrations of fine particles, or carbon soot, skyrocket for up to 24 hours after the show, reaching levels as high as those from wildfires. Also, traces of poisonous metals, which give fireworks their bright colors, and perchlorate, a hormone-altering substance used as an oxidizer, trickle to the ground, contaminating water sources. One Environmental Protection Agency study found that perchlorate levels in an certain lake rose 1,000-fold after a fireworks display, and they stayed high in some areas for up to 80 days. Yeah. That's not really good at all. But because fireworks are so cool, we're probably not going to stop using them anytime soon.

I have been to Singleton, Hunter Valley, Bowral etc. Do a Wine tasting tour in Hunter Valley with nice lunch on the wineyard itself. you can have all kind of meets.

Q460_C19	Yeah Yes, I visited Australia this year in April. It was fun there. I visited Sydney and Melbourne. In Sydney, I visited Opera house, Sydney tower, Sydney harbor, Darling Harbour, Botanic Gardens, Blue Mountains, three sisters and Jenolan caves. All are must visit places.  In Melbourne, I visited Great Ocean Road, 12 Apostles, Warnambool, Ballarat, Gippsland lakes, Penguin Island, Yarra forests, Melbourne city, Crown Casino. Remember, I am talking about only one city and state Victoria.. Whole Australia is a tourist place.... I couldn't go to Gold Coast but Insha Allah next time I will go there first.  People are very nice and cooperative, we didn't see any racism and rudeness stuff.  Regarding shopping, Australia is little bit expensive but DFOs are reasonable.   Now a days there will be winter over there. Sydney has pleasant weather but there are four seasons in a day at Melbourne. Winds are very chilled in Melbourne.  If you find time, travel between Sydney to Melbourne or vice versa by road. I missed it but I heard it is fun.  Have a nice trip!!! If there is any further information needed, let me know.

Q460_C22	Wild Life.... OOh I forgot to mention... visit Sydney Aquarium and  Wildlife at Darling harbour also. These both are in Melbourne as well. You will be surprised to see Australi's wild life... I have also forgot to mention Sovereign Hills (old Gold Field), there is live museum or it is called theme park. They have setup the a city of 1850s and all people are working there in old costume, it is fantastic place I hav ever seen....  and yes make your mission that u have to see Kangroos and Koalas live on roads and trees. In case of Koalas, I touched it and spend some time with Koalas in Sydney Wild life but I had decided that I will see Kangroos live on roads or in jungles... and atlast I have seen them in Gipsland... OMG they were huge......  If someone ask from me which one was the best place, I will say, "I am in love with Great Ocean Road"......

You may have to park your car in the underground parking - QR 1 riyal).  Second option - Electricity Street, opposite Bombay Silk Centre/on the same line with Dulhan.

Q473	Excess baggage? Looking on a couple of other threads and having read  a couple of blogs, tell me if I should pack in my excess baggage: Canned pumpkin Chocolate chips pie pan  And in household goods:(not sure if they will ship food) diet root beer ziplock bags book supply  Curious about: Cookbooks(though seriously I can get anything from the internet, still, you got your tried/trues. . .) Is it hard to find US measure cookbooks?
Q473_C1	Look man .. the easiest way Look man .. the easiest way to satisfy yourself is to call airport or cargo department ... I'm sure they will satisfy you!! cheers
Q473_C2	Shellyjean Ziplock bags, chocolate chips and pie pans you can get here in almost all the shops (definitely Shoprite & Megamart).  Canned pumpkin - sorry don't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here!  Cookbooks and books - Loads of places to buy books here so don't worry. A lot of people organise book swaps and the best place to buy them are all the table top sales!  Diet root beer - can't help you on that one but Shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drinks but they are quite pricey. I would be really careful bringing them over though in case they leak etc.    www.qaws.org
Q473_C3	Canned pumpkin is sometimes Canned pumpkin is sometimes available at MegaMart, but if you want some for this Thanksgiving then I would bring it with you just to be sure.  I did bring a HEAP of ziplocs with me from the U.S.  They're pricey here and I have only found the good freezer bags at MegaMart for $$$.  Seriously, I went to Costco and purchased a couple of packs of the Gallon and a couple of the quart.  Haven't regretted it yet. . .BUT. . .I also had a 40' container and almost no furniture so it was a no-brainer for me.  You can get chocolate chips here, but in the event that you're a chocolate connoisseur don't count on the good stuff.  The waxy-tasting Nestle is about as good as you'll get for chocolate chips.
Q473_C4	Choc Chips Best place for baking stuff (including chocolate chips) is Shoprite - they have Hersheys choc chips :D... One for me... One for the cookie dough...  Giant Stores do cheap freezer bags of every size imaginable but they're not the zip ones they're just the press shut ones..   www.qaws.org
Q473_C5	I'm bringing the Splenda I'm bringing the Splenda cause we just stocked up at Costco before we got the interview. That stuff is expensive and VERY lightweight:)  I appreciate the syrup suggestion and all the others.   How bout coffee? Do they have Foldgers (husband's fave). He is getting weird about the idea of not getting his (exactly the same every day lunch) preferred foods.
Q473_C6	diet root beer is sold at diet root beer is sold at megamart and various stores, I can hook you up lol it's A&W brand
Q473_C7	Definately bring Hi there, Definately bring out the Splenda cause it cost a bunch here... I actually have a friend of mine bring it out for me each time she comes from the States... All the other stuff you will get here - might be a bit pricier than what you would pay there but hey - as long as you can get it.  The root beer am not to sure about....
Q473_C8	Fresh?  I find very little Fresh?  I find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what I would call "fresh" ;)    Yes, bring some canned pumpkin just in case MegaMart runs out.  You can find regular ol' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types .. .but the freezer bags that really hold up are not readily available unless you pay $$ at MegaMart.  (That said, I haven't tried Shoprite.)
Q473_C9	I've been able to get canned pumpkin all 5 Thanksgivings I have had here.  Just don't wait until the last minute and you'll be fine. I still have 3 cans from last year in fact. I can buy freezer bags practically anywhere.  Decent choc chips come and go.  Just stock up when they are here and put them in your freezer.   I do buy cookbooks in the US each summer, only have found British ones here (besides the US current best sellers--which are expensive!)   Diet root beer can also be found--sometimes.  I tried to find a pie pan all last year and know they NEVER had a proper one at the grocery stores. I bought a new pie pan in the US this summer.  My advice:  don't bring food.  My employer didn't allow it anyway, and most don't.
Q473_C10	At the end of the day you At the end of the day you get use to stocking up on what you like when you find it here, and if you can't then learn to substitute or do without. I stopped bringing food back years ago. Our bed mattress was the best thing we brought over. Can't find the quality here.
Q473_C11	Don't stress about the pie Don't stress about the pie pan, I bought three of them and we'll be going to Sri Lanka for Thanksgiving - it's the same as second Eid (Al Adha.) Mandi
Q473_C12	Mandi, better stock up on Mandi, better stock up on cranberry sauce too!!! We'll take it all Mwa ha ha ah.    Splenda is available here in the diabetic sections of most grocery stores - I wouldn't bother bringing it with you SJ.  Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"

Q476	should the landlord also be living in the flat he is subletting to others? i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat. the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us (only comes at month end to collect rent payments). is this legal in qatar rent law?
Q476_C1	RE: should the landlord also be living in the flat he is... Almost all rent contracts include a no-subletting clause.... So he won't be able to do it.
Q476_C2	RE: should the landlord also be living in the flat he is... Bleu; Most properties are actual sublets by agents, if you read my answer again, you will understand what I am talking about, as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the Agent/Landlord and the tennant it is legal. Subletting doesn't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract. these are facts.

Q489_C13	You'd be less likely to You'd be less likely to notice even if they did, as most of the sites you access from North America are in North America.  I expect you'll find local sites are loading at usual speed (try www.gulf-times.com, for example). It's the overseas ones that are slow (like QL).
Q489_C14	I doubt many websites are I doubt many websites are actually hosted in Qatar, or the Middle East. Most will be in the US.
Q489_C15	Actually it seems Gulf Times Actually it seems Gulf Times in hosted in the US as well.
Q489_C16	who is hosted in Qatar? Does anyone know a company that hosts its website in Qatar?   I've found two:   http://www.qatar.net.qa/ - Qtel   http://www.moi.gov.qa/ - Ministry of Interior  Most of the top-10 local sites (nine, probably) are hosted in USA.  Any others in Qatar?
Q489_C17	Dracula QL used to host with Mediatemple, which is based on virtualized servers, but when the traffic took off they switched to <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/">RimuHosting</a>.  There are now two data centres in Doha. One run by Qtel, the other by Meeza, which is part of QF. I just don't know the reason why any non-governmental website would host in either of them.  I know that before QL switched to RimuHosting, they were paying $100 a month for hosting. Now, I'm sure they're paying more, but not huge amounts more. Both Qtel and Meeza are never going to be able to compete on price.  Nor are they going to be able to compete on support. QL is number-three in the top-10 websites in Qatar, and it runs on free software. <a href="http://www.qatarliving.com/user/kutch">Kutch</a> does a great job of running the local free-software group, but there just aren't the numbers of Linux experts in Qatar to be able to provide good support services.  The other reason you might not want to host in Qatar is the local legal framework. Hosting in the USA is sometimes frustrating if you receive a barrage of DMCA takedown notices, but at least the law is well-documented. Here, you can't be sure that someone with a bit of wasta wouldn't make a phone call to Qtel and shut you down.  Of course, there might be a technical reason to host here. If you needed low latency. Maybe the data centres are full of companies' file servers? However, even if I was running an system that require a low ping, surely it's a safer bet to host in Dubai?  Any examples of locally hosted websites???

Q491_C1	No governing rules will work No governing rules will work here practically. If the landlord wants to increase the rent he can create any reason to send you out from his property. Now no need to worry about the increse in rent. Rent is coming down drastically. Change the house
Q491_C2	If you have a written If you have a written contract with the owner, and this contract is signed on or after 01/01/2005 then he has NO RIGHT to increase your rent up to 14/02/2010 as per the law.  If the contract is signed before 01/01/2005 then an increase shall occur as per the following table:  -rent amount less than QR 2000>>>20% -rent amount between 2000-5000>>>15% -rent amount between 5000-10000>>10% -rent amount more than 10000>>>>>5%  In addition he can not kick u out UNLESS you did not pay the monthly rent, or if you rent the flat to others, or if he want to use the appartment by him or his family mambers, or if he want to demolish the building and most of the above has to be through court evidence,,, also there is 6 months afetr you got the information in written before evacuation.
Q491_C3	Rents are supposed to be Rents are supposed to be frozen until Feb 2010. Just find a new place. You will likely find better and cheaper. Leave your greed stricken landlord without a tenant. That will wake him up with no income coming in.
Q491_C4	well the rent depends on the well the rent depends on the area where you want to live ... staying in Doha City area is still expensive even you transfer to a newer flat or villa. If you have car, you can get a cheaper rooms outside Doha and just get-up earlier when going to work.

Q496_C5	If you are living in Al Khor If you are living in Al Khor a bike will be useful. We live in Dukhan and my husband cycles everywhere. It is perfectly safe within the community but I really wouldn't go on the main roads. My husband bought a mountain bike here for 240QR, it's not the best one but is still going strong 3 years on.
Q496_C6	That's a bit more That's a bit more positive!  Thanks, it'd be nice to have the option to get around. Looking at the tour of Qatar routes, there look to be some great 100k+ loops out and around Al Khor.  http://www.letour.fr/2009/TQA/COURSE/docs/parcours.pdf
Q496_C7	Tucky ...Bike is Ok From your post, I sense you'll be quite depressed without your bike. A friend of mine shipped his from the US and now enjoys the (safe) daily rides as early as 05:00 am, to avoid sun strokes and heavy traffic.  I agree with Jasmine, you can ride where you live. Also, you can engage in biking contests and events, held every now and then in Doha.  Stay happy. Salam
Q496_C8	I'm backimg Jasmine! If Al Khor is anything like Dukhan,, you'll miss your bike just to get around. I feel so lazy driving everywhere and I miss mine.  Biking in Doha would be synonymous with 'Death Wish' but otherwise, bring it. I've yet to find a place with deals like you get in the UK (although I suppose it depends how much it costs to ship it).  I wish I'd brought mine. I bought 2 for my kids over here and they're pants.
Q496_C9	Hmm, in Doha Can one bike around neighborhood areas?  We'll be out in Al Duhail North, and though I don't intend to allow my children to bike Arab League St, I was hoping that I'd be able to send them the 1K from our compound to the nearby park on "unnamed" (at least on Google Earth) streets.  Okay, or don't even think it?

Q501	How much is the penalty per day for not stamping the RP? My friend is already done in his medical and finger printing.His current sponsor is not yet processing his RP to be stamp in his passport.In his passport when he arrived here it says within seven days the bearer should process the RP.

If your company askes you to take some extra " long leave" & you go back to your home country, there's a good possibility that you'll miss out on this payment - unless you can get back into the country to claim it. Only a small number of companies doing this in the down turn, but worth keeping in mind.

Q545	Alcohol at the Pearl Am I correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the Pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore?
Q545_C1	Oh My Dayz! When will you ppl Oh My Dayz! When will you ppl stop ranting and raving and crying to heavens above for the suspicion of booze in Qatar? This is totally ridiculous!! Well just for the records, Alcohol sales has been suspended only at the Pearl....that's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of Doha aight?.  Other outlets and hotels and still got it on their menu, besides if you just care to walk in to QDC Im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these stores.   I'm getting very pissed off about the situation here, in the sense that so many expats are just outraged that this one section of the city has had sales suspended!! So they run to Ql to bit-ch about it, as tho if without alcohol, the world would crumbles tomorrow. !!! PFFFF Give it a fockin rest.  If you need booze that bad, you have a problem.! And if living in another culture is so difficult because you may not be able to drink, then you might want to consider just going home to your comfort zone.
Q545_C2	CAlm down DC, wait 'til they are sober, they won't understand you!  Lol!  BTW, it's suspension, not suspicion!  Lol! no offense, DC! Hehehehehh!
Q545_C3	sunday is a working day here sunday is a working day here :)
Q545_C4	Not even a day as member, the OP doesn't understand the issue!  Let's wait for another "newbee" to open up a bottle, errr I mean another alcohol-related question!  Lol!
Q545_C5	Flor1212 if it's just Flor1212 if it's just "another newbie alchol-related question" why are you bothering to post, thank goodness for pros like you who know how to answer questions on forums correctly... oh no wait.. ;)
Q545_C6	Only Suspended... Yup...Alchohol was only 'suspended' from sales on the Pearl (not officially banned). Give them around 5 more months and it will return back to full Alchohol sales. This ban reminds me of a 1998 ban on women smoking 'Shisha' (Hookah Pipes). It was later lifted. Its kind of Qatars way to calm the religious left when they have an incident. I would of thought maybe a religious mans kid came back home drunk and filed a complaint or something? Just a guess.
Q545_C7	/-a-t-/ OP...you are not in @ OP...you are not in Doha and so out of the loop but still can call a shame for the ban. BTW how did you get thinking that Pearl banned alcohol.  And just two words "Pearl Alcohol" returned me the two latest threads on the issue and I think irrespective of whether  you are in Doha or not if you can access QL you can run the search on it too... lazy people....:((  http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2364470 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/2440403
Q545_C8	A suspension that will A suspension that will eventually be lifted when sales are down at the restaurants, which all have Qatari investors who won't want to watch their profits dwindle.
Q545_C9	did you even care to read did you even care to read those threads Bachus?
Q545_C10	United Development Company United Development Company (UDC), the developer of The Pearl-Qatar, issued a statement announcing the resignation of Khalil Sholy, its managing director and president, on Thusrday, Reuters reports.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/12/idUSL6E8CC3BV20120112
Q545_C11	An interesting article http://m.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html Qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship Pearl development may hint at the start of a Gulf-wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears, analysts said.  The GCC states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their Muslim citizens in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest, said Guy Wilkinson, managing partner at Dubai hospitality consultancy, Viability.  Qatar is hardly the first Gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol, he told Arabian Business. Following the Arab Spring, I expect Muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region.  The sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the Gulf states with Saudi Arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor.  The move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non-Muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers, who vastly outnumber the local population. But the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in Muslim countries.  Qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption, said Wilkinson.  Just a few years back, one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures, he said. The fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of Muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption, particularly in terms of moral behaviour.  Chiheb Ben Mahmoud, head of Hotel Advisory, for MENA at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for Gulf governments.  Sometimes, local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors. It is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control, he said.  The suspension of sales on the Pearl could be seen as a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed.
Q545_C12	many thinks it's their rights, when it's already a compromise between the host and the visitors.   And surely, the noisy one will keep blah blah blah! It's just a choice between "more money less booze OR less money more booze"!  Lol! In Saudi, it's "more money and illegal booze", and the expats survive there!

Q546_C2	Thanks, MikaylasMom for the encouragement and the kind words.  How does your daughter do with the flights?  I'm a little concerned with my 4 year old, who's the restless one.
Q546_C3	That's a great question! We That's a great question! We have had a few flights to figure out what to do to keep her occupied and she was 2 and 3 at the time. We got her an iPod and loaded her favorite movies and music onto it. I took coloring books and regular books to read to her. I took a few toys that were small that she liked. We were also in Bus. class so she had a bigger choice in movies and music than her iPod. I also did not fight with her when everyone else was going to sleep. I let her stay awake and watch the movies, then when she was tired, she crashed out and slept for about 5-6 hours. You are going to be exhausted when you get here from trying to stay on top of your kiddo and keeping him/her occupied. It wasn't all great, we figured all this out over about 4 to 5 flights back and forth to the US. There are still some moments when she was fussy. Hope that helps a bit.   Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )

Fortunately, my husband will be with us, and my 9 year old's a big help, too, when he's not fighting with his little brother. ;-)  How old is your daughter now?  Mandi - we arrive 23 July.  We're currently in the process of saying good-bye to all the relations in the East & attending a few family events before we fly out on the 22nd.

Q547	Fees for Changing Car Engine Hi to everyone! I want to change my existing car engine to a new model of the same brand(Honda), how much does the traffic police department charge for changing engines.Your info will be of much help. TIA
Q547_C1	why would they even have to why would they even have to know?

Q547_C3	Code for the engine in a VIN Code for the engine in a VIN is  NOT an engine's part number!  a 17 digit serial number that identifies a car, will have part of it as an engine identifier? .. which means that this identifier should be BIG enough to identify all engines produced for that car which are WAY MORE than the car productions of that model! Do you guys think before you type? Like seriously.. why not just say NOTHING instead of sounding like a butt-head?  Man Not one man in Doha can know if you change your engine.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Identification_Number
Q547_C4	I dont think the hi mojo,  I dont think the traffic department will charge you for changing your engine except you need to have/keep a receipt from where you will buy the engine for future police check or at the annual technical inspection.
Q547_C5	The VIN decodes the "engine The VIN decodes the "engine type". In the case of my car it identifies the engine type as: 4.7L V8 SOHC 16V  If you change it to a V-6 engine, the code will be wrong!

Q556_C3	Ask your friends here to get Ask your friends here to get tourist visit visa issued for you.
Q556_C4	thanku THanku for the help also wanted to ask where can i stay alone as i have heard i cant stay with guy friends, so where and how can i stay.
Q556_C5	You want to get the visa You want to get the visa yourself, you would need to contact Qatar Embassy in your country. No idea about the requirements though.
Q556_C6	You can stay at my friends house. She stays alone. But I'll have to ascertain that you are safe.
Q556_C7	First of all dear we must know your nationality, secondly, your MALE FRIENDS never get a visit visa for you as only Husband,father,brother or any blood relation can apply for a visit visa, QATAR is a safe place if you have self confidence. You can not stay with male in a hotel or any apartment unless you prove that he is your brother,father or husband.
Q556_C8	loads and loads of hotels loads and loads of hotels here to stay ... and tons of flats,houses, villas are empty :)
Q556_C9	Better ask ur friend u can get tourist visa by your own but it will cost you so much, so if you have friends here in doha ask them to get visa for you from some agency such as cleaopatra or fahad.  regarding job issue you can get job easily in doha and that depend on your experience but you have one strong point with you and that is you are FM and it easy for FM to get job here in doha. for accomodation you can ask your friend to find bed space for you till you will not get job so in this way you will be not spending so much for your accomodation. doha is safe place for everyone comparing to another GCC countries, but still you have to be carefull from bad peoples and they are everywhere in all countries. good luck and hope you will enjoy in doha.

Q562	Sushi Hi QLers. I have seen a restaurant which will serve susjhi, is opening near crepaway at Ramada Corner but are there any places currently serving sushi?
Q562_C1	Thank you QS I know you always give a chance for friends to express themselves  ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409
Q562_C2	Well pitstop I don't mean to Well pitstop I don't mean to offend you or the chef. I am sure there has to be more then one person working on the sushi. Maybe I just got the wrong one.   Novita I will try la cigele's. And curious if anyone has tried sakura's yet at the ramada?   Please pass the number of your friend.
Q562_C3	PITSTOP I dont think sth is wrong with Japanese As I mentioned above maybe I was expecting sth different. All I know about Japanese culture was from movies. And if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture -like me-, you can feel disappointment sometimes. For example I am feeling admire for Japanese people because they are almost the leader of Robotic technology, and for electronics they are also on the tops. But sometimes when I experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed. In any case I admire Japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at WWII while keeping their own traditions. And if we return to our original theme I love Sushi too. Am glad that they are so good at it ;)
Q562_C4	Default Nick: Don't worry Default Nick: Don't worry about it. We are all not how we expect ourselves to be. I hope that made sense. And about learning different cultures, I lived in Japan for 9 years, so I know what you are talking about.   Back to Sushi, anyone want a free go at Oishi Sushi :P ??

Q573	Is Kia a good car Hello QL,  Is KIA a good car. How about it parts, is it available anywhere. Is it expensive how about the maintenance of this car. Is worth it to buy this type of brand. Im thinking of buying a RIO. please help need advice
Q573_C1	kia Kia is a good car, i am using a 2008 kia optima and it hasnt given me any trouble so far. all i had to change were the break pads  battery, glass wiper and the headlight bulb which are very normal accesories to change in any car. the parts are very cheap. if i recollect i hardly spent less than 500 riyals for the break pads and the glass wiper. the parts are easily available at the kia service centre in industrial area. The pick up is good and  the ac is excellent.  You should consider buying a KIA,
Q573_C2	Don't listen to us.. See what the experts say .. http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_rio_2013
Q573_C3	There is another CON that can There is another CON that can be resolved with little or no skill.   The cabin AC filters are too small and they easily get stacked with this dusty weather, usually my commute is from very short distances so in 2 years mine is just 13,000kms meaning that I don't do much service in it, one thing I learned is to replace the cabin AC filter kits for maximum efficiency. The kit would cost from 50 to 100 QAR and it only takes 10 minutes to replace it.
Q573_C4	BTW, my first car in Doha was BTW, my first car in Doha was a 2007 Kia Sorento. I bought this car second hand from a British couple. We still have it and my wife is driving it. I've done some offroad at the inland sea and let me tell you, I was shocked with the performance. Our most recent trip was with two friends, both driving their LC Prado (V6 version) and they could not believe what this Sorento was capable of doing.  Kia is probably the most underrated brand. As I said, service is my main concern, other than that it's great for the money.
Q573_C5	What's the warranty here ? 'Cos Kia give a 7 year warranty on new cars sold in UK. Clearly they have faith in their reliability.  I've driven a Kia Sportage and it's OK. Good value for money.
Q573_C6	How about Hyundai Thank QL for giving me these comments and suggestion. How about Hyundai.  I think KIA AND HYUNDAI ARE NOW SEPERATE COMPANY. Any comments on this brand and how they perform on the road. Is it cheaper than KIA? how about it maitenance and parts cost?
Q573_C7	Kia is a good car... Kia is a good car... Sportage is quite good... but not the latest model :(
Q573_C8	favoritetrick, Hyundai is favoritetrick, Hyundai is also pretty good - can not comment on their service since it's run by a different group in Qatar.  Be aware that Kia and Hyundai are very similar in specs and spare parts. I've seen many spare part boxes branded as Kia/Hyundai.
Q573_C9	Its a nice enough car but Its a nice enough car but underpowered particularly in low gears as you start to accelerate - youve really got to "floor it".
Q573_C10	You have to visit KIA SR to You have to visit KIA SR to obtain more information or check the review of the car to http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_rio_2012  For more info please send your queries to jesnetkia@gmail.com or 55107890
Q573_C11	parts and maintenance is parts and maintenance is cheap but performance is cheap too..better to buy a toyota coz the kia rates are close to toyota too in some models.
Q573_C12	Thank you very much for this Thank you very much for this information. i guess i have to think twice before buying this RIO because i red negative review about this car and just want to know from those who have the experienced using this
Q573_C13	dont make a silly mistake, go dont make a silly mistake, go for Nissan Tiida
Q573_C14	KIA Rio I have a Kio Rio Hatchback since 2005 and absolutely maintenance free so far.Yes the pickup is slow but  its a pleasure driving it. Go for it.
Q573_C15	Kia overall has the best Kia overall has the best prices on the market, compared to most brands in Qatar. Their quality is comparable to these 'top' japanese brands like Toyota, Honda or Nissan.  Now, Chairboy has brought a valid point - the Kia Rio version that is being sold in Qatar is a little bit underpowered. I own a 2010 Rio and besides this, I have no complains about the car. I just I could own a manual version but for security reasons is always better to have automatic shift so other members of the family could drive it.  The pluses are: price and quality and the newer models are much nicer and better looking than its predecessors.  The big NO! particularly in Qatar: the quality of service. Unfortunately they only have ONE service center in this country, which is located in the industrial area. In many cases they could take up to two days just for an oil change... last time the car was seldom washed and they did not vacuum it inside.  There is a big rumour that they will be opening a new service center near the old airport area, unless this is true I would not consider buying a new Kia but if they do, I would give it a go.
Q573_C16	They're similar - the last They're similar - the last time I surveyed, Kia was slightly lower.  Just to give you an idea:  Rio = Accent Elantra = Optima Sportage = Tucson Sorento = Santa Fe etc... etc...
Q573_C17	The best thing you to do is The best thing you to do is to visit all your prospect brand, do a test drive and so on....   KIA RIO (Accent, Aveo, Sunny, Yaris, Honda City, Lancer)  Here in Qatar KIA they are giving 5 yrs warranty or 100000 kms.  Cheers!!

Q579_C1	and also, what is the min and also, what is the min investment capital i need to start up a company in Qatar?
Q579_C2	I work for a British Hi AJ,  I work for a British managed company that specializes in partnering with companies coming to Qatar. The most common form of business setup in Qatar is a Limited Liability Company. To incorporate that company you'll require;  - Share capital of a Qrs200,000. - Your Qatari partner must have at least 51% ownership.  - The profit share of the partners does not have to match the shareholding of the partners.   Our company is in a position to act as your local partner. This is the basics, if you'd like to know more, please feel free to PM me for more information.  Best regards, James
Q579_C3	i was thanks for the info.  i was just reading online about the new law that came out, it says that if your in the ICT sector then you can actully own 100% of the company is that true?  Regards,
Q579_C4	Ok, the answer to that is, Ok, the answer to that is, yes and no! It's true this 'law' was announced about 18 months ago. As with many things here, in reality it's not quite as straight forward as it would seem. Yes, theoretically an IT company can be under 100% foreign ownership, however, in practice it seems most of the companies involved are large international companies who have been 'invited' to come to Qatar by HRH.  It's an expensive route to take, and frankly there's little chance of approval. We would be happy to go down this road on your behalf and make the application, though it won't be cheap with an extremely minimal chance of success!  Any other info, let me know.

Q582	Medical Test For Infant - Required ? Medical test is required for infant to extend the visit visa ?  People says like medical test is not required, but you need to pay the 100 QAR in the medical commision for formalities, is that true ?  Why we need to pay 100 QAR for no medical test for infant ?  My kid is just 6 months old.  Let me know your valuable suggestion.
Q582_C1	There is no medical test. There is no medical test.  But they will ask for a doctor's statement giving the infant's blood type (for the medical cards) and it's also worth bringing immunization records.
Q582_C2	Infant need to go Medical Commission or not????? We need to take the infant to Medical Commission as well or I can go myself with all documents and pay the QAR 100?  Other thing, blood group mention on immunization card (from Pakistan) is OK or I have to take blood group report again from any laboratory from Qatar? Thank you.
Q582_C3	No blood test is required for No blood test is required for child upto age of 16yrs.No need to take your child to medical commision.QR 100 is fees for stamping by medical comission on your documents.Mother of the child must be needing medical tests.Better give child's paper with her while sending her in female section as work will get faster there.  Original visa alongwith copy mentioning your mobile no., original passport +copy,PP photo,Sponser's(Father)RP-THESE ARE REQUIRED.NOTHING ELSE!

Q598_C1	RE: Renting Property Thanks! Non you have managed to give a decent answer...
Q598_C2	RE: Renting Property commission depends; if you are paying already enough rent the agents cover it from landlord side  otherwise 15day rent for them is enough,.   the best way is to set your priorities/budget, area and alternate choices and then roam around looking for banners "For Rent" , plus check daily ads in news papers, online ads, ask for references in your family/friends .. i believe over 60% accomodation are not properly advertised and just street search, word of mouth and building caretakers support normally get you a nice apartment of your choice   my 2 cents  good luck

Q604_C1	Try Suri That Tom Cruise daughters name..   The Los Angeles Times summarized the written statement Cruise released on the birth as saying the name "is a word with origins in both Hebrew and Persian. In Hebrew, it means 'princess' and in Persian, 'red rose,' it was claimed in the release."[19] However, magazines and blogs noted on Cruise's mistranslation on Suri's Hebrew meaning.[20] In Hebrew, Suri actually means "from Syria", not "princess".[21][22] The wrong etymology might stem from the fact that Suri is a Yiddish pet form of Sarah, which means "princess".[23] Curiously, in Japanese 'suri' can mean "pickpocket."[24] In Korean, 'suri' is a conjugation of the verb 'to repair' (mechanical devices).
Q604_C2	baby name both you and your husband each come up with 5 girl names and 5 boy names. that's if you don't know the gender yet.  I suggest names with family/cultural meaning.  Then each of you get to strike 2 girl/boy names off of each other lists--no explanations.  then try to whittle it down from there.  use compromise.  for my 2nd son,  my husband picked out a name right off the bat.  I thought it was so so,  but 9 months later I hadn't thought of any that I was crazy about and since my husband LOVED the name he picked out, I decided that it really must matter to him and so we went with the name he liked.   This should be a fun experience!

Q604_C8	baby name Another comment--why worry about it so much yet?   For all of my 5 children we went to the hospital with a list of names,  then when the child was born and we met him/her and discovered their personality, we went with the name that seemed to fit them best.  Sometimes just seeing your baby will help you to instantly decide what their name should be.   It's almost as if they tell you themselves what they want to be named.

Q612_C2	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... Yes, else you will be barred from leaving the country
Q612_C3	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... I always settled traffic violations during registration and never had problem leaving country being frequent flyer...How?
Q612_C4	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... You will only have to pay the violations before travelling if the fines are registered to your Qatar ID. So for a speeding fine that a radar caught you doing will be registered to the vehicle and not your ID in which case you will be fine. If you got stopped at a roundabout for not wearing a seatbelt and the police man asked for your license, then the fine would regisetred against your ID, in which case you would have to pay the fine before travelling.
Q612_C5	RE: Should traffic violations be settled before... it is only mandatory if you resigned and leaving qatar for good... but for frequent flyer not necessary.

Q616	Why is Islam discussed the most? I may be wrong, but of all the religions or lack of, why is Islam the most discussed religion on QL, and others are meerly referred to in comparrison during debates?  If so, why is it that Islam is the most argued religon here?

Q616_C6	Thats right thejam, it looks Thats right thejam, it looks alien to us as far as christianity is concern, comparitabily
Q616_C7	When do you say that an Islam nitpick is a nitpick, britexpat? When one becomes narrow-minded and they easily got offended with it.  Sometimes the illogical part of the religious faith (which seems to not adapt with the modern times) tends to rise up as being legit and plenty of people who stays in a country bounded by that certain religion has no choice but to make it look respectable (There really is a difference between "Respect" and "Making it look respectable") to keep their adaptive ('corruptive' is too direct a term) freedom in bay.  My explanations also work on other religions. We used to 'nitpick' the Jewish (and even Israel) on the other side of the continent for the matter.  Some nitpicks are not nitpicks, but a reflection of the reality (if I don't see it everyday, I never would've known the common obvious)...and some people just can't accept that, hence they perceive it as a nitpick.   "Everything in this book may be wrong." Illusions: The Adventures of The Reluctant Messiah by Richard Bach
Q616_C8	Thejam, well said lucid Thejam, well said lucid points, herein lies the confusion. Pitstop, why do you think it should be banned, how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate, besides isn't that a muslims duty to not shy from discussions regarding his/her deen, but to address and explain and debate? Qatarexplorer, you also made valid points. Yes, some debaters obviously appear to pose as muslims yet clearly are pregiduce. Don't you think that perhaps the debaters you mentioned don't actually hate Islam? People often attack and fear what they don't understand, its humans psychology. I'd like to believe that a great majority, regardless of their negative comments, are actually drawn to Islam because there is something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be searching or yearning for answers.  I only wish that some muslims would debate responsibly knowing that they are at that very moment representing Islam in these peoples eyes and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance, patients & respect when we are faced with not so civilised debates because ALdeen al akhlaq ( religon is manners) This reminds me of when the prophet Mohammed pbuh was driven out of Altayef with stones thrown at him because they refused his message, then God sent him the Angels (of Wind and Mountains) and asked do you want vengence? To this the Prophet pbuh replied (I cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response was) 'They know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people'

Q619_C1	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? exit permit is valid for 1 week from issuance..
Q619_C2	RE: if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty? There are two types of exit permit.  The type good for one use, which expires if not used and and unlimited exit permit which is good for one year.  You should ask for the unlimited kind, if your sponsor is amenable, which will avoid the hassle of having to get one each time you leave the country(there is also a fee charged for the unlimited type), but don't be surprised if your sponsor refuses.  There is no penalty for failing to use either type of exit permit.

Q620_C1	how about doing some research and some reading on the internet http://www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/essential_information/visa_passport_information/uae_visas.aspx  Sometimes public forums do not portrait a direct and straight forward answer but instead each and everyone's experience.

Q621	how much would a family of 4 people spend in Qatar just for food, clothes and entertainment ?? how much would a family of 4 people spend in Qatar just for food, clothes and entertainment ??  Thanks
Q621_C1	RE: how much would a family of 4 people spend in Qatar... It depends on what type of cloths and entertainment you want. For entertainment there is not much to do besides going to the shopping malls or restaurants. You will find everything, from very high end clothing (Gucci, D&G, etc.) to GAP, Banana Republic and department stores. No deals like outlet malls in the US.  Regarding restaurants, depend where you want to dine: Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, TGI Fridays, etc.  Expect prices to be the same to, for example, Boston.

Q640_C3	RE: where can i get plant  seed of road side growing plant? You've probably left it too late for this year as it will soon be too hot for these plants. What I'd suggest is when the plants naturally run to seed, pick a few seed heads and keep them till September, then sow the seeds in a good quality potting compost ready for next winter.
Q640_C4	RE: where can i get plant  seed of road side growing plant? Try a nursery which sells plants

Petunia the one which is available in many color (purple, white, yellow, pink, red , mixed colors) doesnt easily come up when u sow the seeds instead its better to buy a fresh plant with flowers form any nursery ... garden nursery between gulf cinema and mall round abt is where i usually get plants from. Marigold comes in three to four variations and they grow from seeds very well ... like wut baldrick said u cud try it in sep as it already getting hotter ...chrysanthemums also u can find in roundabats and flower in bunches like the above two ,plant is better tahn trying from seeds.  As far as seed is concerned u cud get it from FFC, LULU , Giant or any nurseries .....  enjoy gardening ....

Q645	car's tires I need to change my cars tires. Can you guys recommend me a good trustable shop / dealer, please? thanks.  p.s. They don't have here 'Canadian Tire', do they? :)
Q645_C1	QS, along Salwa Road there QS, along Salwa Road there are numerous tire shops. Mostly they have a big sign for the brand they sell. Here in Qatar it is not neccessary to buy high speed rated tires (HR) type, because the speed limit in this country is 120 km/h. I have an American car and I buy American tires, "Cooper". If you have a Japanese car, buy Japanese tires (Bridgestone), if you have a European car buy Dunlop or Michelin. (But it doesn't really matter much. The speed limit counts everywhere in Qatar)
Q645_C2	Go to Bridgestone/Gettco showroom I recently got tires from there. They are 20% more expensive than the Korean. It is worth it. Just make sure the tires are made in Japan.  They are located right after Thursday/Friday market roundabout along Salwa rd towards Industrial area.  ===================================== http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

For tires made after 2000, the third and fourth digits are the year (04 = 2004). .   The date of manufacture is essential information because tires deteriorate even if they are not used.

Q650	How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage certificate? or any other options? please help!! To all my fellow Filipinos please advice. . I just asked my wife, she said it will take time for us to get a NSO authenticated marriage certificate, we only have the original marriage certificate from our Local civil registrar. . . can we used this to get a visit visa for her? What are our options?
Q650_C1	RE: How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage... Applying for an NSO authenticated MC only takes 1 week, and if you applied for a visa, will take you another week, plus translation in the Embassy will take you roughly 1 week.  So, what's the rush?  Ministry of Interior will ask you to get the stamp from the Embassy, and in order for you to get that from our embassy, it needs to be from the NSO.  If you're really in a hurry, buy a business visa, or book her in a hotel and get the 1 month tourist visa.  If you want the 6 month family visit, you need the proper document.
Q650_C2	RE: How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage... If you need a 6 months family visa you need to undergo all those procedures. But if your wife will not stay more than 1 month here in doha you can go to hotel to apply for tourist visa. La Villa Palace Hotel is issuing a 1 month tourist visa for only 500 QR. you can call this no. to inquire 4367301.
Q650_C3	RE: How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage... if you really want a family visa, you don't have a choice but to do it by the book and get an NSO authenticated MC. what's the rush anyway.. It's better to get the authenticated copy anyway because im sure you'll need it for other purposes as well.
Q650_C4	RE: How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage... Only 1 month maximum, you can get your NSO authenticated certificate. Just go directly to an NSO office near you.  And you may also need the DFA seal (red ribbon seal). That makes it more official.
Q650_C5	RE: How to get a visa without NSO authenticated marriage... For visit visa, as far as I know is that it its fime to have a stamped marriage certificate from you civil registrar. You will just pass it in the immigration unless it will be for Family Residence visa, a NSO Authenticated one is required.  Try in wakra immigration the captain there was absolutely nice..

Q653_C2	RE: Is QR23,000 considered to be good salary? I would... If your salary is gross and if u r not getting housing allowance or any other allowances then it will be difficult to save something...  Housing you need minimum 6000-7000. car and related- 1500 grocery and food - 3500 medical-1000( if u prefer to go private hospital and if no insurance) school- minimum per month - 600/- per child. elect and water-300 other - 750  You can estimate how much u can save end of the month.
Q653_C3	RE: Is QR23,000 considered to be good salary? I would... I agree totally with Pathanamthitta, you will not be able to save much, but finally it depends on you kind of living specially the level of education you are asking for, as you will find an Indian Schools starts from QR 2,000 per annum and up to QR 10,000 for each child. anyway i think you should compare the offered salary and the average for same position.

Q653_C9	RE: Is QR23,000 considered to be good salary? I would... Your salary of QR23,000 is good only if the company will provide your housing accommodation or allowance.
Q653_C10	RE: Is QR23,000 considered to be good salary? I would... I should laugh at the answer of gfxmad (profile Bangladeshi and says Indian in the question).  It looks bit low for a family of 6 without accommodation but still you can manage to live without any savings. Try to negotiate for a family accommodation (3bhk) even if the salary is 20-21k.

Q655	Unsettled Credit Card I am seeking an advice to those who have a wide experience on how I can settle my unpaid credit card since I had repatriated from the UAE. Please, this is a serious matter and tells me the most accurate action to do. Am afraid that in a sudden unavoidable occasion if I will be re-entering on that country, the interest is continuously rising. I have the will to pay but I don't know the procedure. Can anybody tell good advice???
Q655_C1	RE: Unsettled Credit Card If its small amount you may can pay in lump sum. If not speak to the Credit & collection department of that particular bank & say that youre currently working in Qatar. (You may have to send the Appointment letter). That youre looking at option of settling the same and ask how to go about it. or you can speak to the local bank here in Qatar and issue a Standing order to transfer cash every month to your respective bank in UAE.    If you do not wish bank to know that youre working here in Qatar. You can ask one of your relative or a friend (whom you can trust) to deposit on behalf of you to Credit Card account. You can remit cash every month to your friend in UAE
Q655_C2	RE: Unsettled Credit Card You better settle it soon! I am told that UAE has an agreement with all the GCC countries for non payment issues. You pass by the immigration anywhere in GCC, you will be sent to UAE jail. This is not hearsay. It has happened in my husband's workplace! Take care...
Q655_C3	RE: Unsettled Credit Card Thanks for all comments.i would like to pay but is it possible to avoid or reduce intrest?
Q655_C4	RE: Unsettled Credit Card first check how many months payment is delay and then which bank is that if you have local bank like (Emirates Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, NBD Bank etc) then for sure after 3 months delay payment you will get travel ban.   Once you will go to Airport same time they will take you to immigration jail Al Aweer you will be having a court next day, and after 15 days will be your sentence remember the pending payment is one hunderd or one hunderd thousand the punishment will be only 40 days only.  and if its international bank like RBS, HSBC, Barclays then its not too strickt you can convence them but once its travel ban even bank can not remove till you will not pay.   Go to online service of the bank send them mail comunicate with them they will give you solution even you are any where in the bank you can pay them.  Best of luck..............!

Q656_C6	RE: How do I bring equipment into Doha? All of the above answers are good. the most cost effective is for you to carry it in, as long as the camera is going to be for personal use and not proffesional use. there is no issue. If you are going to use it for work, you have to go through the normal channels to get approval. Send me a message I will give you more details. Having said that the XLH1 is not a large camera, so carry it with your hand luggage.

Q658	Prescription Medicine. I am thinking of taking senior work position in Qatar. I am UK citizen and take seroxat (paroxetine) as prescription medicine. Am I allowed to bring this into Qatar? I am not sure how this medicine is viewed within Qatar as a country.Any advice please? thanks
Q658_C1	BRING YOUR PRESCRIPTION I don't exactly know what type of medicine you have mentioned. Just a piece of advice, bring your prescription with you.  Here in Qatar, you can not buy antibiotics without the prescription.
Q658_C2	As far as I know it is for As far as I know it is for sale in the pharmacy with no prescription but some drugs have recently been regulated. Next time I go I will have a look. If it is available it shouldn't be difficult to get a physician to prescribe if you had to but bring a good supply with you as you never know when things change here.
Q658_C3	ant-depressant classification It is classified as an anti-depressant type drug. I suppose my question is ,is it legal for me to bring it as a prescription into Qatar.   thanks
Q658_C4	It's fine to bring these It's fine to bring these drugs in as long as you have a copy of the prescription but, yes, you can buy it over the counter anyway.
Q658_C5	you will have no problems, you will have no problems, don't worry about it. Get a stockpile in the UK as a prescription there is a shed load cheaper than paying the retail price.

Q660	A quick question to Arab speaking Muslims Whilst waiting for my flight to Dubai to take off,the pilot started to speak in arabic. He said "Allah ackbar" (god is great) and then carried on speaking.This speech WASNT translated into English so I have no idea what he said. Does anybody know what he said please ?
Q660_C1	I'd rather have no prayers I'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft. No matter which god you believe in, I'm sure, in your book, he's doing a great job. But, surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious, would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they don't believe in. Pilots are supposed to do checklists, not prayers. Just seen from a non-religious passengers point of view.  If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough...
Q660_C2	PM I can understand that.. Like when I hear something in Chinese :)  One of the Prophet's companions used to hear the Prophet and his companions say rhetoric supplication so he expressed his disappointment to the Prophet that he cannot say what they can saying that he only asked God for Paradise and sought refuge from Hellfire. So the Prophet told him: Around that we supplicate. Prayers or supplications shouldn't be complicated.
Q660_C3	or even better cargodog Why don't you just not fly whichever air carriers who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirements...   Of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she does not secretly place his faith on a God you don't believe in...  Actually, I was just being diplomatic... What I was actually saying is that what you just said earlier was utter rubbish
Q660_C4	I suspect it is what muslims I suspect it is what muslims should say upon each travel. If it was that, which I believe it was, then here is what it said in arbic written by English followed by its translation:  (Allaahu 'Akbar, Allaahu 'Akbar, Allaahu 'Akbar, Subhaanal-lathee sakhkhara lanaa haathaa wa maa kunnaa lahu muqrineen. Wa 'innaa 'ilaa Rabbinaa lamunqaliboon. Allaahumma 'innaa nas'aluka fee safarinaa haathal-birrawattaqwaa, waminal-'amalimaa tardhaa, Allaahumma hawwin 'alaynaa safaranaa haathaa watwi 'annaa bu'dahu, Allaahumma 'Antas-saahibu fis-safari, walkhaleefatu fil-'ahli, Allaahumma 'innee 'a'oothu bika min wa'thaa'is-safari, wa ka'aabanl-mandhari, wa soo'il-munqalabi fil-maaliwal'ahli  Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. Glory is to Him Who has provided this for us though we could never have had it by our efforts. Surely, unto our Lord we are returning. O Allah, we ask You on this our journey for goodness and piety, and for works that are pleasing to You . O Allah , lighten this journey for us and make its distance easy for us . O Allah, You are our Companion on the road and the One in Whose care we leave our family . O Allah , I seek refuge in You from this journey's hardships, and from the wicked sights in store and from finding our family and property in misfortune upon returning. )
Q660_C5	PM: I'm not saying I would PM: I'm not saying I would get offended. I'm saying pilots should be doing checklists not prayers. People can pray all they want, and they can leave everything in life to God, just not when I'm on board the aircraft. I don't believe in god to get me down safely, I DO believe in the pilots to get me down safely.  Veri: It's actually not rubbish. Following link is an example where pilots have relied on God to get them down, but he failed. Maybe if they had done their job proper, those people wouldn't be dead today. That's all I'm saying.  http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/court-in-italy-convicts-pilot-who-prayed-before-crash/  As one of the readers have written in his comment to this article: "The Lord may be my Shepherd, but I dont want Him as my Pilot".  If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough...
Q660_C6	he said, you have during the he said, you have to pay during the journey to arrive safe. especially nowadays, too many crashs! so don't forget to pray ok!
Q660_C7	Apparently he recited the Apparently he recited the verse specified for getting on board of a means of transportation. It could be translated to:  Glory to Him who has subjected these to our use for we could never have accomplished this by ourselves.  And to our Lord surely must we return back.
Q660_C8	No, thats why I asked, Cos it was in arabic.
Q660_C9	ee He said #$@%^%$#
Q660_C10	This supplication is played in QR flights Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Subhanal-ladhi sakhkhara lana hadha wa ma kunna lahu muqrinin. Wa "inna "ila Rabbina la-munqalibun  Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great.  Glory is to Him Who has provided this for us though we could never have had it by our efforts. Surely, unto our Lord we are returning.       As-Sunnah As Saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
Q660_C11	PM Some ppl just can't handle religion :)
Q660_C12	Why don't you guys READ my Why don't you guys READ my posts. I DON'T mind when people pray. I DO mind when they leave everybody's fate in the hands of God. If you know your English, you will understand that "I DO mind when they leave...." doesn't mean "I DO mind that they all leave..." In other words, I'm not saying everyone is leaving everything to God, but some do and it only takes one bad apple. That's all I said.  QL: I can handle religion just fine. I just can't handle when religious people can't handle the truth.  Veri: Nope, the one thing I can promise you I wouldn't do if I knew we were crashing, is scream "I believe, I believe...". I would be looking for the nearest exit and if time permitted, I would write a letter to my family. But that's just me...  If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough...
Q660_C13	and some people just keep on and some people just keep on arguing about religion   it's not the pilot, it's not the crew either.......it's our tea boy..Khalas..Khalas..Khalas..Khalas..Khalas..Khalas..
Q660_C14	It meant "Allah is the It meant "Allah is the greatest"..!  ~noms~ ----------------------------------------- "Before God we are all equally wise ' and equally foolish" - Albert Einstein
Q660_C15	Cargodog You say this...  "I'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft. No matter which god you believe in, I'm sure, in your book, he's doing a great job. But, surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious, would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they don't believe in. Pilots are supposed to do checklists, not prayers."  and then later you say you don't mind when people pray... now you really have me confused
Q660_C16	I'm not surprised Veri. I I'm not surprised Veri. I give up...   If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough...
Q660_C17	This happened during the This happened during the prohpet's time, after finishing a prayer, a man got outside the mosque and did not find his camel which he left. the man, surprised, said I depended on God! (which we should do) and the prophet replied, tie it and depend on God!   So I agree with those who should confirm checklist is completed and not just depending on god while the tank would run out halfway!
Q660_C18	PM It's not recorded. The pilot says it after going through his checklist. It only takes 10 seconds.
Q660_C19	QL dua is recorded this doesnt mean Pilots dont supplicate Alhumdullilah most of them are in Wudu    As-Sunnah As Saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
Q660_C20	Eco-savvy Yes probably it's recorded becasue sometimes pilots are non-Muslims.
Q660_C21	Verisi good that Cargodog has not travelled Jeddah sector entire journey is nothing but glorification  Subhanallah   As-Sunnah As Saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
Q660_C22	why recorded or not...... why would any pilot say that in the first place.   Aana free, jaana free, Pakde gaye tho khana free.
Q660_C23	he said fasten your seat he said fasten your seat belts..right?
Q660_C24	No, cos it would have also been said in English as well It was all in arabic.

Q667_C4	My ex- maid was having an affair when she was here, probably lots of them.. and her hubby was at home looking after the kids.  She met him in church as she was so devoted to her religion and ethics.

Q667_C24	harry, if you wouldn't harry, if you wouldn't consider that as unfaithfulness, then does that mean rajah should just put a poker face, and wait until he stops philandering or hop from one woman to another? stand up for yourself and your kids. you might lose respect for yourself. don't ever let that happen to you.
Q667_C25	blippy.. I think Harry was being flippant..  If Rajah Park is silly enough to ask such a question then He/ She deserves a flippant answer..  I prsonally think that this is a troll having fun at our expense.. There have been too many similar threads from so called Filipinas lately..
Q667_C26	BRITEPAT thats ur opinion..for me its never silly to ask such question like this when u know that sometimes we need some advise..ur culture our culture is different when its comes to marriage we don`t give up that easily.. as long as we could keep the marriage.. this things happen to me its not a joke or what.. i just need some advise and m taking my time to think rather than decide and regret later..

Q667_C28	If he's cheating on you then If he's cheating on you then show him the door... simple... he would never accept you cheating so why should you... and for all those "idiots" who are telling you its a normal thing as a guy, I think they are talking a lot of BS...when you marry you marry with the aim of staying together... if you cannot keep it in your pants (Guys)or gals then separate and go your own ways... Being unfaithful is something that no matter how many times you say you will forgive never happens... its there in your mind forever and eats away at you.....

Q667_C37	to answer the question on - faithful - truthful, loyal, or true (to you).  As for relationships broken caused by being away w/ each other, only your guilt of conscience can help you realized that. It's a matter of choosing your own destiny.
Q667_C38	ram it doesn't matter if your wife tell you such. If you don't wanna have an affair, you just don't. Respect your wife as you respect yourself. Treathening is not the cure for cheating or lying or whatever!  "so wag kang nega! BIXOXA!!"
Q667_C39	FranElizabeth, just for FranElizabeth, just for curiosity sake, did you let her husband know ? I ask because I was in a similar situation. Only it was my friend/colleague. She used to have fun while her family/husabnd thought she was with me / busy in a business meeting. Whenever her husband called to inquire I had to lie (as she asked me to before leaving with her BF). I thought it was'nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband asked me directly if there is another man in her life and I had to lie. She is no more a friend but I carry a guilt because I know her husband really cared for her and looked after the kids in her absence.

Q667_C42	We have no right to judge people eh!!! Darling,   Unfaithful is just a word, nobody really give a important to it.men are men if they slept with other ladies it doesn't  mean he loves her or he is ready to give up his family hey!! come on.. if you only look on scientific side its so simple... men needs to ejaculate once or twice a month (if i'm right?)but,anyway, they have to for health reason how they do it, its up to them. for women we don't need because we menstrual period every month. and husband without his wife on his side is very difficult.the stress of everyday routine. sometimes you have to understand that men are not saint. as a wife you know your husband very well.  women working away from home like middle east are not looking for married man because of sex experience.. they are looking for "knight in a shining armor" shoulder to lean on. stable and good paying job,huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activities for free.mostly no string attached. hey! its not the end of the world welcome to computer age.. you can do something productive than crying and feeling sorry for yourself you can twist everything its all up to you.cheers
Q667_C43	rajah just because he is here and you are there, is no reason to accept his unfaithfulness. Just like him, you are alone...have you cheated on him? My guess is no. You have to make the decision as to what you can live with and what you can't. Don't just take it because he's a man...be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what is right for you and children. When he returns, have him get tested for any and all sexually transmitted diseases before you let him back in the house because if he has them, so will you if you let him back in your bed.   If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
Q667_C44	whoa liliachalmers... Men don't HAVE to ejaculate each month!! Who in the world fed you that line of BS???!!! There is no health reason for this "need".  Men and women's sex drives are basically the same..its how its dealt with that's different. You are giving the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he "needs" to??? Get real!!  There is no biological requirement for that. And even if there was, they can always give THEMSELVES a helping hand..they don't have to go looking for a woman to have an affair with. Geez...get real..  If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
Q667_C45	rajah it depends on HOW you rajah it depends on HOW you found out!, is it thru your own knowledge, or just a message from your friend, or your relatives gave you that information.  sometimes it is very deceiving when things came up into our minds. Here is a classic sample..  The Boss and the Secretary.. One day the two of them drove to the Hotel, someone saw them while entering into the hotel, after an hour, the two left the Hotel. This witness spread the news that the two have an affair, they went to the hotel to release their desire. (Take note the witness wasn't sure what really happen inside the hotel)  The truth is, The Boss and the Secretary went to the Hotel to talk to the Manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the Hotel.  for the meantime just trust your husband.. he maybe unfaithful as what they say but still he is your husband and the father to your kids.  <a href="http://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl?file=3753&occ=27">RACHE ist Bergwerk saith der Lord</a>

Q667_C47	Rajah, u may cry a river Rajah, u may cry a river over the situation, but my dear, u've gotta be strong. This thing (sadly) happens whether he's assigned to work there or in ME.  U said u've talked 2 the girl and could'nt do anything... well u better do sumthing while u cry girl! crying isn't always a sign of defeat... Once he comes back home, show him how faithfull you've been opposed to what he has done, if this wont make him realize his mistake and rectified his misdoings, then by all means -dejar que se vaya, termine!  -easier said than done eh? yes it is but if worst comes to worst - why settle to an UNFAITHFULL husband when you deserve much better, i dont mean u get even with him by doing *** let him realize what a LOSER he is for messing up ur family...!!

Q668	Duration of stay for tourist visa? Help!!! My friend came to Qatar last 29 August using a tourist visa. He is on his way to change his tourist visa to rp but he is quite concerned that his rp may not come out before the Eid holidays. They were telling that theres no work for immigration for 10 days due to Eid holidays that might start next Friday or Saturday. How long will he be able to stay in Qatar? Is there a way to extend his tourist visa?
Q668_C1	RE: Duration of stay for tourist visa? YES, you need to go to the Immigration Building # 4, Madinah Khalifa. First of all, ask the typist (outside Building # 4) to type ur tourist visa extention application, then go to building # 4 with that application and original passport. They will charge u QR 100/- for one month visa extention.
Q668_C2	RE: Duration of stay for tourist visa? Thanks. He really needs that info. He is quite afraid that he will go exit if his RP does not come out before the Eid holidays. He was only issued a 30 day tourist visit.
Q668_C3	RE: Duration of stay for tourist visa? Hello friend, I do not think Tourist Visa is extendable beyond 1 month. Because, 6 months back I have arranged Tourist Visa for one of my relatives to come to Qatar through Cleopatra Travels.  At the time of applying Visa itself, PRO of Travel Agent had warned that it was strictly unextendable. The simple logic is if there is any chance for renewal, the process must start from sponsor i.e. Travel Agent and defnitely not by us. Anyway, you may enquire at Immigration at Garaffa. So my advice is better not to take any risk or chances of overstay since the penalties are hefty. Good luck.
Q668_C4	RE: Duration of stay for tourist visa? dear speedmark,  did you try it out...please tell me also...since mine is alos the same case with my wife..i hoped that her RP could be done in this month but it willd efinitly get extended. So I am also worried about the same. Any clue?
Q668_C5	RE: Duration of stay for tourist visa? Dear Vinith,  The travel agency that we took the tourist visit visa told us that tourist visas cannot be extended beyond 30 days of stay. They offered us to make an exit to Bahrain and go back to Doha for a new 30-day tourist visa. However, we opted that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hired him and without going out of the country. It will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to RP because his sponsor is his company.

Q673	Gatorade for kids? My kids (2 yrs and 9 yrs)  loves to drink Gatorade, i know gatorade is an energy drink (for rehydration) mostly for athletes... Its is safe for their age.??
Q673_C1	RE: Gatorade for kids? Energy drinks are often mixed with alcohol. Where energy drinks are stimulants, alcohol is a depressant. The mix can be particularly hazardous as energy drinks can mask the influence of alcohol and a person can fail to take its effects into consideration.[21] Normally fatigue would set in as large amounts of alcohol are being consumed, but the stimulating effect of energy drinks can override this effect.[22] Often drunk with vodka or in shots it has lead to increase in the purchase of pre-mixed drinks also known as alco-pops often containing guarana or taurine extract which provides energy drinks with their flavour.  avoid giving them ,make them to drink fruit juice.
Q673_C2	RE: Gatorade for kids? Hi Abno, thank you for your advice..Recently i read that information in Wikepedia..anyway thanks a lot.God Bless..
Q673_C3	RE: Gatorade for kids? what I give you now is not a Wikepedia cut & paste.  Most of the Energy drinks consists of Stimulants , some of which are used as "doping" by the athletes.  Initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy, but studies showed that such stimulants weakens the nervous system in the long run.
Q673_C4	RE: Gatorade for kids? Gatorade does not have alcohol and is not considered an "energy" drink such as Red Bull. Gatorade helps to replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost when participating in physical activities. It is also a good drink to have when you have been ill to your stomach.

Dubai doesn't have days such as "Family Day" in Malls, everyone is equal and when I say everyone..I mean it!  But the best part is....Dubai's general mind set is at least 2 decades ahead of Qatar.

Q682	where can i get my makeup done for less than 200 at which salon does it cost less to get your makeup done?
Q682_C1	RE: where can i get my makeup done for less than 200 its very hard to say that you can find or done your make-up less then 200 bc normaly rates are according to the occasion.i'm a make-up artist and my charges for model or party make-up 300qr and then go on and on so obviously saloon takes more then that but hopes maybe any saloon did this job so cheaply.
Q682_C2	RE: where can i get my makeup done for less than 200 its very hard to say that you can find any make-up services at this rate,i'm a make-up artist and my rates for model or party make-up is 350qr and then go on and on,obviously saloon takes more then that,normaly rates are according to the occasion so hopes and also wish that you can find or did your make-up at this rate or maybe you'll find any saloon who did this jobn at very cheep rates.
Q682_C3	RE: where can i get my makeup done for less than 200 I agree with the fact that it depends on the occassion...But dear I can tell you something that will be a good help for you. During weekends there are usually make-up artist that came from european countries who came to Qatar to promote what ever brand of Make-up they are selling. It usually happens at Sephora, debenhams, highland and the likes. You will be lucky if the occassion that you need to go to falls on weekend. They can do your make up for free! Well almost...because you need to buy at least 1 of their items. But at least you get your make done by a real proffessional for a fraction of the price. Hope this thought helps you. Good luck!
Q683	Anyone know how is Al Bayyan compound ? We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound. Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?
Q683_C1	RE: Anyone know how is Al Bayyan compound ? Not good
Q683_C2	RE: Anyone know how is Al Bayyan compound ? Al Bayan Compound used to be only for Qatar Petroleum Employees only until recently when they have allowed a certain amount of Villas to be let out to outside people.  Generally the Compound is good for the price you are paying for it. Decent size Swimming pool. Rooms are quite big size. It has a shop etc.  So on a whole for the price that they are charging it is a good deal. If you want better than you have to pay more.
Q683_C3	RE: Anyone know how is Al Bayyan compound ? Thank you UkEngQatar. Your input is very helpful.
Q683_C4	RE: Anyone know how is Al Bayyan compound ? Based on what I heard from friends who lived there temporarily (newly hired QP employees), or renting there:  Pros: - It is decent for the price - location is pretty OK - Villas are good size  Cons: - Temporary accommodations for QP newly-hired, high turnover of tenants - Furniture is horrible, old and bulky - Area gets very congested near Saad Stadium when there is a game  When it comes to housing, it is relative and greatly depends on your life style and what you are used to. I would say visit a few times and see a few villa's before you make your decision.

Stay away of this school and try other ones. Such as Global, Doha College, DESS.   We and our friends had a terrible experience in regards to learning. Some of us managed to send the kids to other school and some are looking for places for their kids.

Q701	IPhone Advice, Please! Should I buy an IPhone here in the US and bring it to Doha (have it unlocked there) OR should I wait until I move to Doha in August? Will Vodaphone be up and running then? Any advice is helpful! Thanks!
Q701_C1	RE: IPhone Advice, Please! I think it would be better to the buy the iPhone here. You get a warranty although its a bit expensive here. And about the unlocking bit, fear not cuz it's a 2-minute thing.
Q701_C2	RE: IPhone Advice, Please! I would suggest to buy it from here in Qatar but it's rather expensive.. Got mine at QRS 2500. You can also buy it from the US and have it jailbroken here.. softwares (for unlocking and jailbreaking) are also available on the net, specifically on eBay. The problem is that 3G iPhones doesn't have an unlocking software yet in the market.. only for 2Gs... just check first before purchasing or you'll end up with a phone that doesn't support the network. Have you considered buying a Nokia 5800 instead of an iPhone? :P
Q701_C3	RE: IPhone Advice, Please! I got mine from UK and unlocked it here, had a look in the US as well, but couldn't find one with no contract, but it is definately cheaper than buying in Doha
Q701_C4	RE: IPhone Advice, Please! you can not enjoy some of the features that is offered loacally if you buy US unit. and you may spend more of unlocking. local unit though more expensive but with warranty and guaranteed you will enjoy all features.

Q714_C1	All companies would look at <p><a><strong> All companies would look at experience, education, but they wouldn't hire people just to hire them.  They would need an "open position", and they would want to evaluate many people who's CV matches the requirements, and chose ONE person to fill that position.   The companies will post the jobs on their websites just as a formality but finally these jobs will be filled with less competent guys who are the relatives/friends of those cunning guys in the same organistion.   This is true in the case of companies like Qatar Petroleum etc.   For example,SAP recruitment process in QP now is 100 percent illegal as many qualified guys are not considered even for the initial phase of interview so as to reserve the posts for the lucky relatives/friends of those cunning guys in QP.

NOOOOOO... QFA has reversed it's decision to give the ICC tickets to sell to Indian fans because they claim that a large % of  the tickets are being sold in "black" i.e people are buying up tickets & then selling them around town @ a higher price...so restrict the number of tickets sold per individual,that should severely restrict if not completely prevent the black marketing...it's not bloody rocket science...

Q722_C5	A number of my students A number of my tuition students are from Parkhouse. There seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject.  Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) is limited. You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that don't. Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum.  Finally, Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales. The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum, which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government.  This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school.  You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College, DESS, Sherborne and the International School of London.   Good luck.
Q722_C6	schools As a user of the Qatari and British education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher, your child and you are lucky! Usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire YOUR child! Be glad when you get one, no matter what school they are paid by! Education is about inspiring children to progress, not about checking off what they have studied!
Q722_C7	Craftyqueen, let me tell you Craftyqueen, let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes, given to a volunteer parent (who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions) who is supposed to help them develop reading skills. Not only is that wrong, but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class. And don't try and tell me it's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1. Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House. The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking! Waiting hours for nothing? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem!
Q722_C8	I am surprised you Alumnar I am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on QL.  Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place.  In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read.  I can't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading.  If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion.  In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week, their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible.  The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week.  Parents are asked to participate in their child's learning by listening to their child read at home.  Schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere.  As for fairness - the World is not fair and no school can be fair 100% to everyone because not everyone agrees on what is fair - its personal opinion.  If a child is brought up thinking the world is fair they will get many shocks when it comes to finding a job!
Q722_C9	Parkhouse Some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading. For example, are we comparing Parkhouse (or any other school in Doha) with fee-paying, independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school, I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison.  One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are "extremely high". Well, if there is an acute shortage of school places, then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates.   I have not heard much about Parkhouse's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their "extremely high standards". That also might explain Parkhouse's preference for nice, white English children.  Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC, the Supreme Council of Education. This is a body set up by the Qatari government and it is most probably run by a bunch of idiots. Therefore it stands to reason that anything endorsed or recommended by the SEC must be pretty awful. If the SEC were really so smart and so super efficient, then there would not be any private, fee-paying schools in Doha at all because every single parent would want their little darling to go to a wonderful Qatari school. In reality the Qatari schools are very bad and more foreign, fee-paying schools open every year and most parents (both Qatari and expat) seem to want their children to go to "international schools". And have you ever heard of such a thing as a Qatari teacher? No, I thought not.
Q722_C10	Any Update?? Dear All, some comments were positive & some were negative..this was in 2010...now we are in 2012 ... ccould anyone update his point of view....or share his kids experience as a parent?? because I'm about to put my TWO kids there.. thanks :)
Q722_C11	Shouldn't parents take Shouldn't parents take responsibility for their children's education? call me stupid but if your child is lagging behind in reading writing or what ever shouldn't you as a parent take time out and do it with them at home?. Instead of blaming the schools/teachers for this.Education starts at home! :)
Q722_C12	Shouldn't parents take responsibility? I dislike having to disagree with a fellow hippopotamus, but I do not think that Pink hippo17's comments are very sensible. Many expat parents in Doha are not trained teachers. They are engineers, doctors or whatever, but they are not teachers. That is why they pay lots of school fees and send their children to school, in order for the children to be educated by trained teachers who are supposed to know what they are doing. Yes, of course very young children learn a lot from their parents, but a lot of parents simply do not have the time, the training, the experience or the resources to teach their children at home.  As for SEN children (those who have Special Educational Needs), I think that it would be true to say that there is a lot of pressure on many schools in Doha to focus on the more able students and to ignore the needs of children who are struggling. This is particularly the case in fee-paying schools. Schools that want to boast about their "high academic standards" do not want to give school places to children who might not be able to live up to these high expectations. SEN children usually need additional individual help and (surprise, surprise) that usually costs money.  For many children in "British" school, primary education is, first and foremost, all about language development. Even a Maths or a Science lesson is really all about the English language, as English will be the medium of instruction and a good grasp of the English language, both spoken and written, will be needed by the students if they are going to participate in the lesson and produce written work based on what they have learned. Therefore there is a lot of pressure on schools like Park House to reject non-British children and to offer school places to nice, white English-speaking children who have nice, white English-speaking parents.
Q722_C13	Wow, I didn't realise you had Wow, I didn't realise you had to be a trained teacher to help your own kids!..If my son hasn't understood or struggled at school as parents me and my hubby are always there to help,that's all I'm getting at..Some parents haven't got the time, your words..Sad that! :(  We've been paying school fee's for years, so yes, you expect a high standard from the school who wouldn't?..But what would I know, I'm just a nice white English-speaking parent! :)

Q726	Manual or Automatic Which car is better manual or automatic?
Q726_C1	RE: Manual or Automatic Personally, in Qatar; Auto.  There are so many idiots around that it is much easier to concentrate fully on the road, rather than the gears.  There is also not alot of 'smooth' driving in Doha; lots of stop, start, stop at traffic signals, so automatic saves all that '1st gear, neautral' arm-work.  Just my opinion!
Q726_C2	RE: Manual or Automatic Due to traffic congestion, preference for automatic gear.  If you buy new vehicle, then go for Automatic gear vehicle.  Manual gear vehcile is going away from the current market.
Q726_C3	RE: Manual or Automatic It is preferable to go for automatic for ease of driving and better focus on road to reach your destination...............more importantly traffic is growing in GCC and if u intend to drive down to Dubai..............than better have automatic car to ease ur tension and stress building on roads.................
Q726_C4	RE: Manual or Automatic for girls : automatic for boys : automatic is better bt still manual is ok

Q736_C7	RE: Does anyone know where to get a money order? depends on where u want to send money, most exchanges will give a certified cheque drawn on a bank in the receiving country a low rate, most Indians seem to send their money this way, costs only a few riyals rather than the 30 riyals my exchange charges or the much higher Western Union rates. I have used it to issue cheques in the UK and the Eurozone Much cheaper than a telegraphic transfer but u have the postal delay and have to wait for the cheque to clear. Go to a good exchange, they may have an account the country ure interested in.  above all don't send your money thru the banks as their rates are higher.  try the Post office as well and make ur choice good luck

Q744_C2	RE: Remittance UBL near (Old al Ghanim) Cornich is the Best option for Pakistanies
Q744_C3	RE: Remittance If you have ICICI bank account in India from any of your family member, then you can send it through Gulf Exchange near Al Fardan. Gulf exchange will charge you Qar.15/- transaction and it will get credited in 12 working hours, means if you deposit in morning, ICICI account in india will be get credited by evening and also they pay a good exchange rate compare to other exchanges in doha. The only you need for this is   ICICI bank account number, Name of the account holder, Branch, and amount.  This service is known as Instant Transfer, you can check or ask about ICICI transfer on Indian counters available in Gulf Exchange.  I prefer this is the safe way compare to western union, amount ger directly credited in Indian bank account also high rupee value compare to western union.

Q748_C3	Japanese musical equipment Japanese musical equipment is about 30 to 40 % cheaper here! No VAT, only 4 % import tax.
Q748_C4	Buy all that at Dixons duty free and save the VAT. I saved 150 pound on my Mac at Heathrow.  Pretty much all electronics are MORE expensive here than any where in the World. Pocket digital cameras average about 60-100 pound more. I saw a laptop I brought my Dad in the UK going for almost DOUBLE here in Carrefour.   I find it cheaper to shop at amazon and pay aramex to ship it here and it's STILL CHEAPER !!  Obviously this won't work with a huge TV but everything else get back home.   Also anyone with a residents permit for Qatar can buy stuff in the UK and get the VAT back at the airport. Always remember to do this when you buy expensive things on your holidays.

Q749_C18	love marriage both ... its different in the beggining but later same .  personally i will say love because i neva wanna be with stangers .
Q749_C19	Well This debate is indeed an endless one. Usually, those who are comfortable in their marriage would always have you believe that it is arranged marriage or love marriage, whatever their specific  case, which is better.   On the contrary, those who are not happy in their marriage will always claim that the form of the marriage other than they had is better.   The fact is that there is simply no way to tell which one is better. For some people love marriage works magic, for others arranged marriage opens the heaven's door.   To a large extent, it luck.

Q756	Opinions on Facebook Can anybody give me their opinions on Facebook. I was thinking about setting up an account, but it won't let you check out profiles unless you sign up, unlike Myspace which lets you look around before you sign up. Is Facebook better than MySpace or the other way around?
Q756_C1	I heard that they changed I heard that they changed Facebook and it sucks. What sucks about it??  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q756_C2	well... well in my opinion, both are good.... facebook has got more popular over the months and even hit headlines.... my space was the same to back then.... it was just as popular just as cool....  but i stuck to the facebook profile since it has loads of games and information....and is still developin
Q756_C3	go ahead and open up a go ahead and open up a facebook...it's easy and it's free...i don't really see a reason not to.  keep in mind though that it's starting to die off...within 18 months it's gonna be as popular as ICQ and something else will come in it's place.
Q756_C4	So if I open up a Facebook So if I open up a Facebook account, if I don't like it, can I delete my profile? I am just wary of it since you can't check it out without signing up.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q756_C5	yeah definitely...some yeah definitely...some people are also a little worried over how their information will be used and stuff but that's all just good old paranoia.  open one up, check it out, and if you don't like it then deactivate, it'll be as if you never signed up in the first place :)

Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q756_C8	nfh...the only personal info nfh...the only personal info you get plastered all over the internet is the info you provide.  facebook can not find out anything about you that you don't tell it...there is no spyware in it that follows you around to other sites and sees what kind of person you are from other internet activity...the whole mess about personal information abuse was that it was going to be used as a statistics tool for marketing purposes  if you're uncomfortable with sharing some stuff then don't! facebook doesn't require any real information from you...the fact that you can open a fake account proves that facebook is not out there to get you and your personal information though, if it was that kinda site it would be much much harder to open a fake account.

Q757	Bring Great dane? Hi everyone.  I have been in Doha for 5 months, but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back, but I would like to bring my dog with me. It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?
Q757_C1	maybe you can bring this cute maybe you can bring this cute one. i have seen many here. you just have to comply on some requirements of bringing one here, get some permit and you should have  with you his/her birth certificate.
Q757_C2	:) yes he is adorable Would you happen to know which requirements I need to comply? And which permit I need to get?
Q757_C3	Heleneg Contact Qatar Pet Travel....they have a good website and will let you know all the details
Q757_C4	I think you don't have I think you don't have permission to bring big pet..so for kind information you should contact Qatar Pet Travel.    http://www.amirafoods.com/
Q757_C5	heleneg Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar. Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information.  Please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal.  Doha is not a bad place for pets. Its the same the world over. Just because Qatar is a small country, it seems like we are over run with animals.  Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar - Europe (if thats where you go to next) requires added documentation.
Q757_C6	Yes, just try contact Qatar Yes, just try contact Qatar pet travel. i understand your desire of bringing your Dane with you. my daughter like your age is also keeping another kind, so adorable and sweet. Try search of possibilities of bringing her in.
Q757_C7	Seriously? Up to last year big dogs were not allowed.. but things are obviously changing... As Oryx suggested, contact Qatar Pet Travel.
Q757_C8	Thank you all for answers :) I was actualy considering to drive to Qatar with the dog. It will be a lot cheaper and it will be an amazing experience! I just thought that the great dane might have been on the 'ban-list' in Qatar? But I will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say
Q757_C9	How would you drive here? How would you drive here?  You, as a female, are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. I don't know where you're coming from but if, for example, you're coming from UAE - you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities/vets, probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via Saudi (if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him, his sister, or his daughter or his mother) and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar.  If you're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through, it gets even more complicated on the document side.  I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country
Q757_C10	I will be coming from Denmark And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit. Also, I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi, as women are not allowed to drive there.  When I was last in Doha, I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible, but now I see that they are only restricted, so I guess I have all my questions answered.   Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard, so apart from the heat, the dog wouldn't get it any better. :)
Q757_C11	Saudi may not recognize your Saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father.  You should check that out before making any firm plans.
Q757_C12	Oh.. Maybe you are right. He Oh.. Maybe you are right. He is also my sponsor in Qatar - do you think that would be enough?

Q760_C4	RE: Is Cultural Village open yet? there are a couple of restaurants  that are opening within the next few months, i think.  i visited with a friend of mine and we saw a nice Indian Restaurant and an Egyptian traditional restaurant. i dont know if they are fully open but we saw some people inside.  we also saw some other restaurants right in front of the beach area. one was looking like a nice lounge with great interiors! (we saw only from the outside of course!) and the bigger restaurant looks like they will have a show kitchen (with glass windows to see the kitchen).   the place is huge with a nice view of the pristine beach. they have cleaners everywhere to keep the place tidy. i cant wait for it to open to the public. im sure it will be one of the nicest spots in Doha.

Q763	Shelf life of tires. What is shelf life of car's tires and how can I know while buying new one.
Q763_C1	RE: Shelf life of tires. shelf life:  http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/glossary/shelf-life.html   about tire shelf life:  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3088188 http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=459895  one said he had over 5 year old tires mounted and they are perfect for a few years...  it is not the km you drive it is how you drive and they are work out  it is also not the years... again it is HOW you drive and they are worn out.  but before you mount them they have to be save..  I try to google and no one has a 100% correct answer to this Q..  but at the end they have to be save so just dont by old tires, it is your safety buy fresh new and crispy not spoiled tires and be save.
Q763_C2	RE: Shelf life of tires. MRST2009 thanks for the joke early in the morning. Shelf life for tires is 2 years, 60,000km or 3 years is after you mount them.
Q763_C3	RE: Shelf life of tires. from the web...  Should tires be assigned a shelf life, like groceries, milk or eggs? A safety research group says aging tires develop cracks or weaken when they sit around unused.  Tire makers in Britain have just issued a warning to consumers. Replace tires that are more than ten years old, even if the treads not worn. And for a tire that hasnt been used, like a spare, replace it after six years.  Reviewing U.S. lawsuits, the research group says that many accidents involved old tires. According to strategic safety expert Sean Kane, weve been able to document in a very short period of time at least 20 cases involving serious injuries and fatalities in the United States, and weve only scratched the surface of this issue here.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  but read this one:   Shelf life not the answer  But the U.S. tire industry says a shelf life is not the answer. Donald Shea of the Rubber Manufacturers Association said: What it is is a complex series of events that can make a tire deteriorate. One, is the amount of mileage; two is the abuse it takes on the road; third and perhaps most important is the maintenance that is given or not given to the tire. If the public gets the impression that they could continue to use a tire until that use by date that could send clearly the wrong message.  When the NHTSA proposed an upgrade to new tire standards it also proposed an aging standard. That was deferred for two years because no one could agree on a reliable test that could artificially age a tire. The NHTSA is in the process of determining which test is best and hope to have research done by next summer. <!--break-->
Q763_C4	RE: Shelf life of tires. You can check manufacturing date from the stamp on the side of tire. Stamp shows the week and the year tire was manufactured. Look for 4 digit number inside rounded rectangle. For example, if you see 4007 it means tire was manufactured on the 40th week of 2007. SImilarly if it shows 1208 it was manufactured on the 12th week (early March) of 2008.

Q772	What is the best way of shipping of boxes to Qatar from USA? I will be moving to Qatar soon from Unted States and would like to see what is the best way of shipping my belongings there.  Thanks
Q772_C1	RE: What is the best way of shipping of boxes to Qatar... Google and you'll find some shipping companies. They don't come cheap. They all have a minimum weight that you've to pay for, whether or not your stuff weights that much.  And you must select it to be shipped via sea. Usually reaches Doha in about 30 days.  This is relatively cheaper way to transport items in excess of 200 lbs to Qatar.
Q772_C2	RE: What is the best way of shipping of boxes to Qatar... How many boxes and from where in the States? Just shipped out of FL with a 20' container, so I may be able to guide you a little.
Q772_C3	RE: What is the best way of shipping of boxes to Qatar... Try Aramex or DHL... Even UPS works... or TNT...
Q772_C4	RE: What is the best way of shipping of boxes to Qatar... Over and NO!  Wow this question keeps popping up constantly.  The simple truth is leave your stuff there as you are not moving here permanently! The money and time you spend shipping items here AND back will be the price of the items. Don't waste your time and don't be so attached to inanimate objects.  Prices here are reasonable enough that you can get a TV and electronics for almost the same as at home. Washers and dryers are actually cheaper - almost half the cost. Believe it or not quality mattresses are half the price as well - shows you how much you are gouged in the US.  Furniture is cheap and will last the time you live here. It's disposable furniture, replace every 5 years... Count on spending 10 percent of the first year's salary on air cleaners, dryers, dishwasher if not supplied and you'll be fine. You can sell everything for half price to co-workers or on Qatar Living classifieds area and you'll be ahead of the game.  Buy your furniture here at Homes R US and electronics at Carrefour, Giant Store or Lulu and you'll be comfortable. It will cost you money to ship or to buy so just buy. Simple as that.

Q791	Question About Marriage Assalamu 3laikum,  Can a Muslim who is a US Citizen marry a Qatari woman? Is it illegal by law, or not? What has to be done for the marriage to take place?
Q791_C1	I just CANNOT About culture: I just CANNOT relate to most of the "Arab Americans". The Gulf is where I belong, I follow Arab culture in every way. Every day I find my desire to live in Qatar multiply exponentially.  I just do not like Western culture, I dont know why I was born in America. It just is not "me", I just cannot do anything Western, I tried once, and now ask myself why did I even try to be like a Westerner? Everything in Western culture is backwards to me. This is not my society. Its NOT that I am "trying too hard" or anything, but it just comes naturally to me to be Arab, and do things the Arab way.  Not every single Gulf Arab is perfect, I know this, and every country has its problems, but you have to admit, this is a beautiful, traditional country with a lot of history. And to those who said I should  marry in Europe or USA, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING when you told me this?!  Not only is that illegal, but absolutely wrong.  Ahhhh my difficult life; good thing Islam prevents me from commiting suicide....

Q791_C11	Being Arab isn't enough out Being Arab isn't enough out here dude. These people, as good as they are discriminate amongst each other over family name and color let alone an outsider coming in.  Try as you will, come here and it wont take you long to realize you will never belong. You will never be one of them. Its an elite club you are born into.  These are not insults to these people, I like them very much. I work with one westerner only the rest are Qatari. I live in an exclusively Qatari neighborhood. I pray with them in the mornings and evenings and sit with them in their homes but the fact is even if I marry one, have kids and die here... me and the kids I will produce will never be one of them. NEVER. You talk about marrying a girl from here..Their parents know what I say is true and that's why you will have a hard time to find one to marry and an even harder time keeping one if you do marry her.  No one is trying to take anything from you man. These are simple things you need to know before you come out here with altruistic ideas and end up with an angry heart.  Again, I say you should try Saudi or Yemen, these issue do not exist to the extent there that they do here. ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/

Q791_C13	Thank you Mandilulur, but I Thank you Mandilulur, but I know the obvious!  I was asking about the law, like if it was illegal or not.
Q791_C14	You need permission from the You need permission from the Qatar government in order for a Qatari to marry a non-Qatari.

Q803	Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? Can this be brought from outside the country? Will there be checking for this at the Doha Airport when you arrive from outside?
Q803_C1	RE: Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? They sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy, some you will need a local prescription for (available from a primary health doctor or specialist) but usually just buy over the counter. You are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering Qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok. Receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no. It is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs (including a face mask I ordered from Elemis but I did get it back.)
Q803_C2	RE: Is Cipralex a controlled drug in Qatar? You'll need a prescription for it. You can bring it in but make sure you have a note from your doctor saying that he prescribed it for you

Q806	For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa applicable? Dear All,  I like to ask you a genuine Query  1)I know ,Ladies can work in Qatar with Husband Visa. Whether Gents can work with Wife Visa?   Thanks for comments in advance
Q806_C1	RE: For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa... According to new rule, it is possible i guss..
Q806_C2	RE: For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa... according to the new rule, yes, it is <b>possible</b>. Although still very complicated. doesn't mean everyone automatically gets it. Only ladies on the high positions/with high educational level can sponsor their husbands. Also the nationality of the sponsor and sponsored husband is taken into consideration. And of course high salary level.
Q806_C3	RE: For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa... Max123, such a confident answer  might mislead and disinform  people. Just curious, are you (or someone close to you) an HR specialist in Immigration laws in Qatar?
Q806_C4	RE: For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa... old & new law both is applicable.  good luck straight ahead toward immigration Dept and apply.
Q806_C5	RE: For Ladies- Husband visa. But for Gents- Wife visa... <i>Yes....according to law, it is possible with the factor of your profession in your Visa & Salary range (above 7000/-).  One other factor is the MOOD of the Immigration Personnel....May Allah Help You with THAT.... :D
Q807	Arriving in two weeks, should I bring my Bycycle, or are 'new ' prices reasonable? As above  I have a decent road / touring bike, I have read some of the threads regarding cycling. Does anyone know how much Airlines charge to bring a 'boxed' bycycle,many thanks
Q807_C1	RE: Arriving in two weeks, should I bring my Bycycle, or... I was chatting to someone about cycling at the weekend. Apparently i've done the right thing shipping my bikes out as buying a decent brand new here will cost 2-3 times as much as elsewhere.  Best check with companies such as Excess Baggage Company or other freight forwarders re shipping costs. Most will send a bike boxed if you take the pedals and bars off. Don't go to the airline direct, you'll get ripped off.
Q807_C2	RE: Arriving in two weeks, should I bring my Bycycle, or... Better to bring your one, here its expensive...

Q809	Aspire Gym fees? Ive been looking to sign up for a gym after ramadan. and i was wondering if anyone here knew how much they charged at aspire gym (women's section ).
Q809_C1	Mandi 150 QR per month. Mandi
Q809_C2	wow! that's not too bad at wow! that's not too bad at all :o)
Q809_C3	If you sign up for nine If you sign up for nine months it's even less. And they offer over 130 classes per week. Mandi
Q809_C4	Hi dear Check your inboxx plzzx..
Q809_C5	The 150 QAR per month The 150 QAR per month mentioned by a previous poster is the 'add-on' price for using the gym. You have to also have paid for membership, which is 200 QAR per month. So, it works out at 350 per month.  I was there this morning making enquiries. They are not accepting any new members until after Ramadan. Membership begins at the first of the month, so that means new members will be accepted from 1st October.   You can attend a class without being a member. There's a charge of 50 QAR per class. You can't do this with the gym though. They have spinning, pilates, circuit training, yoga, etc.   They also do guided tours of the facilities on Monday, but these won't resume until after Ramadan.  Hope this helps.
Q809_C6	mozzie, do you know what days mozzie, do you know what days are pilates classes?
Q809_C7	Aspire is TERRIBLE! its very inconvenient and very expensive...and they have no sense of customer satisfaction. I bought a membership and now during Ramadan the swimming is at 9:30 at night!!   WHO makes these stupid decisions!!
Q809_C8	flanostu It is permissible to swim during the day in Ramadaan.  Muslims rinse thier mouth with water before prayer during fasting. there is not a single hadeeth that advice otherwise  unless you're making this up ;)
Q809_C9	and not making it up genesis.  and to make matters worse, when i was living at ezdan the pool always mysteriously closed for cleaning during ramadan, so of course that just added fuel to my thoughts...haha
Q809_C10	mmyke Aspire Active is a governmental sport institute meant for the local community in the first place. it's expected that the timing is adjusted during Ramadan to suit all.  you can always join a hotel gym, you know ;)
Q809_C11	and what does the "community".. include?  or rather exclude. ...and I don't think people actually drink pool water.... Just shows how far and illogical this is all taken..

Q813_C6	Are you kidding?  This place Are you kidding?  This place still IS still part of the Anglo Empire (now being run by the Americans rather than the Brits but still Anglo).  Favorite sport:  English football/soccer.  Huge effort to get the WC 2022 here.  Language: more people speak English than Arabic in Qatar.  Primary/secondary education:  British curriculum (or versions of it) prevails and is most sought  Universities:  colonies of American universities  Economy: petroleum products extracted by mostly American companies, distributed by mostly American companies and used to fuel Anglo Empire and other economies.  Professional class: lots of Brits and other Anglos managing everything from banks to education to infrastructure  Shopping:  malls are American look-a-likes packed with shops that are all over Anglo world.  Whole concept of mass shopping like this indoors is American.  Health:  people getting obese just like in other parts of the Anglo Empire as they feast on burgers, chicken nuggets, fries and Coke.  Defense:  Mostly-American made weapons and a big US military presence  Politics:  Considered a close ally of Britain, US and other parts of the Anglo Empire.  Cars:  The favorite Land Cruiser is made in Toyota's American factories.  Dress:  Blue jeans (American) and business suits (English) prevail.  A Gap in every mall.   I am not saying this is good or bad.  It simply is, and personally have no problem with it.
Q813_C7	OK I might be wrong, But was OK I might be wrong, But was it not the British who endorsed the current ruling family in Qatar?
Q813_C8	Britain was not a big Britain was not a big influence when it was a protectorate, but as Olympics wrote, a much larger influence afterwards and indirectly (via other parts of the old Empire).  I suppose it all depends on how you interpret empire.

Q816_C4	RE: Which is laptop is good? Chk this link for more.. . .  http://www.jarirbookstore.com/catalog/laptop/HT-21026356RED.asp
Q816_C5	RE: Which is laptop is good? There are several considerations in buying laptops and here are some of the basics..  Looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognized as an old one, so you have to select which is the most updated and stylish in terms of appearance. Right now, most laptops are getting thinner compared to their predecessors. Also, a laptop which is small in terms of screen width (14 inches below)is so stylish and more handy. Any brand of laptop can be as stylish as is seems depending on your taste.  Battery Life - this is also a major consideration in buying laptops. It also creates a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short periods only. In my experience HP laptop batteries are far better from any brand. Just always remember that when you are charging your battery, unplug the cable once it is fully charged. If you are going to use your laptop for a longer period of time, it's better if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop.  The first two are basic considerations. Below points are dependent on your applications the laptop shall be subjected once it is in operation. Applications are graphic designs, web-designs, softwares, chatting, gaming, audio and video, emails and web-browsing, etc.  Processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 GHz speed  for better outputs of your applications.  Graphics - if you want good graphics, select a laptop with G-Force in it.  Operating systems - Vista and its predecessor, XP is really far from each other. Although all new laptops are basically equipped with Vista OS, try on having two OS's like XP on one drive and Vista on the other (Dualboot), so you can be more flexible.   RAM and HDD - random access memory (RAM) and hard disk drive (HDD) are also to be considered if you want higher applications. Anyway laptops right now are arriving at 2GB RAM and 250 HDD at minimums.  Hope I'd helped you on selecting a laptop. Basically, we cannot really say what laptop is the best; it depends on your preferred application usage.

Q820	Are U.S. College Degrees Valuable in Qatar ? Hi Forum,  I'm currently a student in America,  completing my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from an accredited U.S. College.  I heard that degrees from American or British colleges are very valuable in Qatar,  is this true ?  I will also pick up experience before applying for a job in Doha.  Please kindly let me know,  thanks.

Q820_C2	well said edifis well said edifis :)  ex.ex.expat,That is why I said it depends on how one spend :) cheers.
Q820_C3	ex ex Yes he is American, but he has Asian roots and if you know your land well, you will know that the Asians over in the West are know for having a "savings account". So maybe he does not lead the "extravagant" lifestyle your family leads and $2000 may suffice for him for starters.  IMHO, depending on where he worked, yes he could get more than $2000 in the US, but the problem over there is there is more supply than demand for the type of work he is looking for.
Q820_C4	There is no harm in trying You  SHOULD put your ideas in action rather that talkingjust go to   http://www.qf.org.qa/output/page19.asp   http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/index.asp?cu_no=2&temp_type=44   There is no harm in trying
Q820_C5	Vegas Unfortunately there are a lot many job seekers who will come here for $2K/ month. Many of the Asians see this as a stepping-stone for better prospects. Besides, $2K for an Asian is a lotta money.
Q820_C6	Not for an Asian American Colt You seem to forget the chap says he is American. Why would he come here for such a low salary? As a stepping stone to $2500/month? Another low salary. This is very low by American standards from what I know.
Q820_C7	Yes, he's just starting off and he hasn't even got a degree Wouldn't it be better to tell him the truth and encourage him to get a degree, rather than chase  low salary half-way around the world to a place that is more expensive than where he is?
Q820_C8	ex ex I never told him to come 7000miles across here chasing a low-salaried job. I was the one to tell him the pay will not be more than $2K approx.
Q820_C9	Btw ex ex whatever made you think he's not getting a degree?
Q820_C10	His other thread colt. He wanted to come here for a job at one of the universities he didn't get, said he didn't have a degree and inquired about whether it was necessary.
Q820_C11	Doc we're not fighting, we're debating :-P...   Btw, he has clearly mentioned in the post that he's completing his Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from an accredited U.S. College.   Regarding his job, he said he almost got an IT related help-desk job at Carnegie Mellon. I don't know what happened to that one though :-(
Q820_C12	teksource84 Well, that's great that you have it planned out...  If I come across any help desk job that pays that range, I'll let you know!
Q820_C13	Hmm, not to be negative here Hmm, not to be negative here but a young person just starting out with a newly minted degree may not have that much success here in the Gulf. Just my observation. Mandi
Q820_C14	Epi Rishi is correct on that one... and that is what I have observed a lot in the Gulf... A EU/ UK/ US/ AU etc. passport will get you a better position with a better payscale in most companies in Doha.  Another observation I made here is that, to be a secretary, you don't need short-hand, nor do you need typing skills (min words/ min etc.) As long as you're under your husbands sonsorship, you can get a secretarial job.
Q820_C15	This is gonna turn into the This is gonna turn into the typical 'why do westerners earn more' bashing topic which has been discussed a million times...

Q820_C28	Having worked in recruitment Having worked in recruitment for the past 8 years, I would say experience is way more important than having a degree.

Q836_C1	RE: I-PHone All Apple Iphone's are made in China.
Q836_C2	RE: I-PHone do you want iphone made in euthopia?
Q836_C3	RE: I-PHone i think he's referring to the replicas, not the original one. I've seen them in Dubai (in the huge Dragon mall near international city). It's not really an iphone, although it looks like one. Chinese went creative with those and added few features, like some of them take 2 SIM cards, and I saw one that's actually small. they're also much cheaper (~300-500 QR). Screen resolution, software, etc is doesn't compare to the real iPhone. If you're planning to buy one to convince yourself that you have an iphone, then don't, because it won't work. Otherwise it might be worth considering.

The best long range router is undoubtedly a wireless N router and i.e D-Link DIR-825/N or Linksys WRT54GL or WRT54G,( thanks2 Bluepanther for sugg)  you can do some twiks and try if it works, in most cases it works.   - Open the router's administration tool & log on and make below changes - Update the MAC address of the router (i prefer using MAc address) - Set the channel range upto 11  - Secure your router and ensure that you use wireless encryption and/or MAC filtering and check it  Beside you can place a router after configuring with Wi-Fi tools where you get more signal. Try -   inSSIDer 2 wifi tool (open source software) and track the chance. Good Luck !

The reason I asked the question is that in western countries usually, the trend is that private companies estimate the annual pay increase of their staff by looking at government's pay increase. For example, if the government increases the salary by 3%, they may increase by 4-5%.   I work for a private company; in my contract, it says the company will review the pay each year. Hopefully it means that it will only go up :-) So I wanted to get an idea of how much it will go up by? Cheers

Q862	Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an employees Passport? Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an employees passport?  It was bought to my attention that a company was in control of employees passports.  I do not know the law regarding this but it does not sound as if it is fair to me.  Does anyone know if this is allowed?
Q862_C1	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... no this is illegal.   One should request the Passport and if not given you can go to Embassy or police. Passport is property of the country issued and illegal to be hold back other by a government authority like Police for valid reasons.. (but not a Company)
Q862_C2	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... Your passport should be with you and not with your company.
Q862_C3	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... Illegal - as your passport is actually the property of your government
Q862_C4	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... you should have your passport with you. Companies are required to give back the passport of their employees after fixing your immigration concerns and visa.
Q862_C5	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... In law of QATAR its illegal!!! all company is it not allowed to keep the passport of the employee,it written in their law...but most of them are not obeying  their own law...most of the company are holding the passport of there employee and its happening, where you will go yanee!!!to complaints them!!!where and who will help you!!!for them its fair!!!QL pls...be yourself answering the question of others,maybe you may help them or giving a false hope pls...DON'T just be straight forward ok...what u know then share it bash!!!thanks and more power...
Q862_C6	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... It is illegal but normal in Qatar!
Q862_C7	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... It doesnt make a difference since you cannot leave the country without an exit permit
Q862_C8	RE: Is it legal in Qatar for a company to hold an... It might seem illegal but the passport doesn't serve its purpose even if it's in your hands. Should you need to exit or leave the country, your company still needs it in order to arrange for an exit permit. Also,it's better to let your company have it for safekeeping. There have been lots of stories or even appeals in the daily papers of people who have lost their passport while it was in their possession.   In our company, passports are stored in a fire-proof safe. The staff have the option of either keeping the passports with them or letting the company keep it. Majority prefer to keep it at the company's safe, it also guarantees that the Residence Permits are renewed on time, as it is a common practice that it is renewed a week before its expiry.

Q871	which bank would you prefer to start an account??? Am living in Doha...i wish to start a bank account here..please guide me about the documents needed to start an account....
Q871_C1	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? Can't say with authority but I would guess that it is best to open an account with a bank that has a presence in your own home town.
Q871_C2	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? To open an account you need Salary Certificate and Iqama copy with ID copy or passport copy. Open an account with QIIB or QIB, if you take personnal loan or car loan.. there interest rate is very low compare to other banks. If you are looking for good service then go for QNB.
Q871_C3	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? I believe QNB has the best banking services, but perhaps not the most suitable interest rates or offers. You call any bank for required docuemtns to open an account.
Q871_C4	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? any bank will do
Q871_C5	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? It is better to open the account with those banks which has your company accounts. Else, you will be charged for transferring salary on a monthly basis.   ie; suppose your company is holding an account with Doha Bank and you have opened an account with Ahli Bank, you will be charged QR.25 for salary transfer every month.   The documents needed is your Passport Copies &  Your ID Copy
Q871_C6	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? I use both DOHA BANK and MASHREQ bank...Doha bank is quite good in service when you want to remit your money to your home land..
Q871_C7	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? Soniya, Money remittance is not the only service provided by Banks... I will never recommend Doha Bank... The worst customer care... I suggest QNB or Ahli..
Q871_C8	RE: which bank would you prefer to start an account??? Dear, without the company letter you can only open a saving account (with approx around QR500 as a starter deposit). All the expat require a company letter to open a current account.  please give a try to CBQ (2nd largest local bank in Qatar)...website www.cbq.com.qa and if you require help PM and will try to assist you.

Q882	New school times What do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in British Curriculum run international schools?
Q882_C1	I think when u r in a Islamic I think when u r in a Islamic country, one needs to learn the culture and their language too ?
Q882_C2	So ? So ?
Q882_C3	parents will not mind if parents will not mind if school increased the lessons of arabic/islamic but teachers are suffering coz they forgot to increase their salaries.  in international schools all teachers are getting good salary except the arabic/islamic teachers, they get less than 30% of the other teacher's salary, simply no fair
Q882_C4	Yes you are right osama and I Yes you are right osama and I dont understand why arabic staff get paid less than other staff. It is baffling to me. Some parents have complained at the new times, especially in the younger classes because the day is too long.   No rizks, I want to know how most parents feel about the longer day for their children, due to the new compulsory increase in these subjects.
Q882_C5	Since when has the school day Since when has the school day got longer ??? Not in our school!!!
Q882_C6	My children don't even have My children don't even have any Arabic classes. The school only offers 1 second language choice in which I chose French. Honestly I'm a little disappointed they are not obliged to take Arabic.
Q882_C7	lost in Qatar, I would not lost in Qatar, I would not worry...very few children, even in schools where Arabic classes are obligatory, actually learn Arabic....for various reasons.
Q882_C8	those subjects were there in those subjects were there in the 80's in all the schools.
Q882_C9	My kids learned Arabic from My kids learned Arabic from their friends, because they spent a lot of time together at the beach and in the dunes! It's easy as that. In their school Arabic was a must for Arabs, but a choice for non-Arabs.
Q882_C10	Coming from Dubai, where it's Coming from Dubai, where it's mandatory, surprised that it is not here.  My children learned quite al ot in kg1 and grade 1, they learned the alphabet, learned how to read and write. They didn't always understand what they were reading, nonetheless I was shocked on how much they had grasped the language. Went back to Canada for a year and now no Arabic. I am seriously thinking of hiring a private Arabic teacher. I'm sure it would all come rushing back to them.
Q882_C11	2 hours of Arabic used to be 2 hours of Arabic used to be obligatory to all Arabic speaking children and 1 hour of Islamic studies to Muslim children. Now they have introduced 4 hours of Arabic to all Arabic speaking children AND non-Arabic speaking children. 2hours of Islamic and 2 hours of Qatar History to all students.   I have had mixed opinions so far from parents but heard quite a lot of negative ones.   Kids are absolutely shattered come 1 o'clock.
Q882_C12	Well, as to my experience, if Well, as to my experience, if you mix Arabic and non Arabic speakers who, obviously, are on totally different levels in the same class, things have to go down the drain. Plus, the teaching methods of the Arabic teachers and the other teachers are vastly different.
Q882_C13	Ah ok Mt, it was different in Ah ok Mt, it was different in the school my child used to go to.
Q882_C14	What exactly are their school times now? 7am-1.30am is my daughter's timing and she attends one of the Independant Arabic schools. Are these Internantional schools actually going on for longer? That would be very taxing!
Q882_C15	It used to be 7.15am - It used to be 7.15am - 12.15pm for Early years, 7am - 12.45pm for KS1 and 7am - 1pm for KS2. Now its 7 - 12.30 for early years and started off 7am - 1.40pm for KS1 & KS2, now its 1.30pm.   Big jump for the wee ones especially KS1
Q882_C16	Yes I would agree for the little ones It must be tougher and I don't believe it will reap much benefits as the kids will be prolly too pooped out to concentrate much on anything  let alone grasp a new language. Hope the teachers then make the classes as fun,captivating and creative as possible.. Not to mention loud nuff to snap them outta their sleepy haze!

Q885	Apartment comparison advice Hi guys. I am looking at 3 possible apartments to rent in : Bilal studios al asmak Y village al waab Zig zag tower.  Anyone have any views on these places? They are all similar prices but y village is 24 month contract, is this safe? Is there anything I need to watch out for or ensure I do when renting one of these properties?  Thank you!
Q885_C1	it also depends on the area it also depends on the area you want to live in. It looks like all of them are in the opposite sides of the city. I personally eliminated Bilal studios al asmak for the area reason. Is it somewhere on A-ring road, correct? I simply hate this area. Zig Zag sounds better in terms of area, but again i have heard so many negative responses regarding this place, that I cannot advise on it. Not familiar with Y village.. is that a compound? building? who is the owner?
Q885_C2	what do you mean "additional what do you mean "additional charge for the aircon i.e. Qatar cool'? you have to pay for electrisity, dont you? what is qatar cool?

Q885_C4	I have not visited them yet I have not visited them yet no. I'm moving over in 2 weeks and have viewings set up. Y village seems to be my top pick at the moment. It's developed by ramco, how are these guys to deal with? The issue I have is the 24 month contract, it seems pretty restrictive. What if after 6/9 months I hate living there due to various issues?   Bilal is on A ring, what's wrong with this area?   Thanks!
Q885_C5	Sorry I believe it's 'ramaco' Sorry I believe it's 'ramaco' and not ramco
Q885_C6	where is your office? your where is your office? your options are in completely different sides of Doha. If your office is in West Bay, you better take ZigZag tower, as you will spend at least 30-40 minutes coming from this Y-Village (still not sure where it is exactly, looks like new development, and sounds pretty far.)and going back there. Do you need it?  I don't like A-Ring becuase this is old bad area. Everything is old and ugly there. Simple. You need to know where our office is.
Q885_C7	Qatarisun has a very good Qatarisun has a very good point. You should consider your work location. As for the duration of the contract, best to choose a place and then negotiate a deal you are most comfortable with. You don't have to sign for 24 months but you may have to commit to at least a year. But you can try negotiating - you never know it might work.
Q885_C8	The office is in west bay. The office is in west bay. Would it really take up to 40 mins to travel there? That's not ideal. I thunk I'd like to live in a compound as I feel like there is a bit more freedom than a huge tower block. Is there anything like that in westbay? Y village isn't even open yet as it is a new build.   Does anyone know of any similar apartments in close proximity to westbay for a max of 8k per month?  Thanks!
Q885_C9	in West bay no such prices in West bay no such prices for compounds. Not too many compunds there either. Mostly towers... Only may be somewhere in Golf Club area, but it's again pretty far. I think your best choice with your location and budget is either ZigZag or Ezdan. Although both of them are not the best quality, as actually everything in Qatar. At least you will be close to your office. By the way, I think in Ezdan you can rent for short term, such as 1 or 2 month. And then you will have time to look around, and find somthing that you like.
Q885_C10	My names Craig, I'm the Hi,  My names Craig, I'm the MD of Mirage Properties.  I'd suggest you take a short term rent, say 1 month, to allow you to look around Doha before committing to a long term contract.  Regards your choice of properties, we've have been dealing with Ramaco properties for a number of years and can tell you that the quality is good, Y Village, once opened, will be a great compound. However, the journey to your workplace would be at least 45 mins each way, as you couldn't find a compound that's much further from your workplace.  I can't comment on Bilal towers as we don't deal with them but I hear the quality is good, but as most have said, the area is not the best.  Lagoon Plaza or (Zig Zag) as they are known, has developed a bit of a poor reputation, mainly due to early problems with maintenance and the issue with district cooling (Qatar Cool). Although District cooling is common in the UAE, it's a fairly new concept here. It works well but is an additional utility cost on top of your electricity and water bills.  Zig Zag is in a great location and will soon have a large mall and outdoor cafe/restaurant area (developer says will open in May but expect Sept, after Ramadan)  We have apts available in Zig Zag within your budget and many landlords are prepared to negotiate on the Qatar Cool cost.As a rough guide Qatar Cool should cost just over QR5 per sq mt per month. As an example a 98sq mt 2 bed apt would cost around QR500 in total cooling charges, however some landlords will include the supply costs within the rent and leave the tenant to pay only the consumption charge, this being a small part of the overall cost, approx 10-15%.  I hope that helps and if you require further advice or wish to see a wider selection of properties please feel free to come back to me.  By the way, unlike many other agents, we don't charge you a fee for finding you a property!  Kind regards  Craig at Mirage

Q896	Nursery for 2.5 year old with Down syndrome? I'm looking for a nursery for my 2.5 year old with Down syndrome. Ideally I would like her to be in an integrated environment with typically developing children at least for the preschool years. Does anyone know of a nursery that would accept a child with special needs?  Also, what schools accept children with special needs here in Doha? I've heard of Shafallah but thats hard to get into if youre not Qatari.
Q896_C1	For your child http://www.hope-qatar.org/  all the details r in the site My Dear this is the site. The Director is Dr. Mrs Ciby Mathews. Get all the details.... They will take good care of your child. Cheers
Q896_C2	hi But your Nationality says you are QATARI....then whatz the issue?
Q896_C3	there is one school in abu there is one school in abu hamour,for kids with special needs..also 1-2wks back i had seen an adv about such school in classifieds of gulf times,browse their website for details.
Q896_C4	I'm not Qatari. DRSADIQUA - I'm not Qatari. DRSADIQUA - what is the name of this school? Also, I am interested in a regular nursery (not special needs) where there is integration with normal children.
Q897	Can we make the best for all of QL? For a 4 Yr old child and on ward: 1. What is the school you recommend? 2. What is the advantage and disadvantage? 3. How much is the total yearly cost? 4. What are the main languages which are taught in the school? 5. What is your advice to overcome a problem you have faced with the school your son or daughter are studying in?
Q897_C1	Couldn't have said it better, Nom Despite all the imperfections, the numerous schools and education centers in Qatar offers us,Locals and Expats,who are contrasting and multifarious,one thing:choice.
Q897_C2	Your profile reads you are a Your profile reads you are a Qatari , and you are asking us expats?
Q897_C3	First we have to know what First we have to know what kind of education you want for your child. As Frenchies said, values/ educational needs  may differ.
Q897_C4	Ok this is a tough one 1.In all honesty I am not totally satisfied with the schools here, but since both my husband and I wish that our daughter should become fluent in Arabic, we have her in an Arabic Independent or "musthakhilla" school.   2There are deffo plenty of cons but since she is now rapidly improving in her Arabic, and doing good nuff in her subjects I will prefer to keep my complaints between the school staff and us. Suffice to say I guess that no school can ever be perfect!   3.Around 12,000QR  4.Arabic and English only  5.Well I'd say it's always best to build up a good relationship with the school's administration and always address them promptly when faced with any questions and concerns. This is crucial.
Q897_C5	Seriously, if SA wants to Seriously, if SA wants to know what IS now, then this is it: 1. No school can be recommended 2. Therefore this question becomes obsolete 3. Current fees are between QAR 12.000 to QAR 70.000 per year 4.English and another language of choice (Arabic, French, Spanish, etc.) 5. Administration should involve parents much more. Currently there is just a drop-off and pick-up service the parents are involved in. All together: the school system in Qatar is Stone-Age and a SHAME for the so-called 'Richest Country in the world'!
Q897_C6	Furthermore, subject teachers Furthermore, subject teachers should have AT LEAST a Masters Degree in their subject and should be continuously be trained! That should, however, go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salaries. As it is now, education is cheap in Qatar. Cheap in the sense of low quality. All there is are expensive buildings!
Q897_C7	Frenchies-- you are new here.   I have been here 9 years now.   for 9 years my children have attended a school where there are over 67 different nationalities.   There are muslims, Christians, buddhists, hindus and even jews there.   They all exist in peace and mutual respect.    What school?-The American School of Doha and NO ONE has ever tried to indoctrinate my children into anything.    All they have done is provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship.   Don't talk of what you don't know please.   Our family values are still very much in tact.
Q897_C8	Yes, the ASD. But how many Yes, the ASD. But how many students can it accomodate? 50.000? What about the poor ones? What's the fees again? 60.000 or 70.000 all together? So, we have one school in Qatar. It's occupied by children of oil company employees and a few Sheikhs. What about the 90% other children??
Q897_C9	Schools indoctrinate? Which Schools indoctrinate? Which ones? Maybe the Qur'an Schools.
Q897_C10	Ohhhhh no!! They are going to get this thread whacked too....poor brother straight Arrow and his vision to make QL best for all. Guys have pity on him and let him accomplish his mission..please no religious arguments now!
Q897_C11	3. 1. None 2. Same same 3. 20.000 to 70.000 4. English 5. Leave Qatar
Q898	Any upcoming QL parties? I'm sorry if this is old news or if there is some obvious post I should have read.  Just curious if Ql'ers ever arrange meets/parties/barbecues/etc?  Would be awesome if there was one ... next month sometime lol.

Instead going up to Jaidah Flyover, you go on the roundabout under the fly over. Turn left on the roundabout, drive all the way till to Manai Roundabout and make a u turn.   After you make a U turn, just befor you reaching back the jaidah fly over, on the right there is small shopping complex that call Al Nasrallah centre or something like that (not too sure).

Q911_C7	Doha reptiles In doha the sighting of anything other than geckos is rare but will increase as urbanisation continues and the reptiles become familar with the new habitat. There are several excellent books on snakes of Arabia, however, you are only likelty to see them if your adventurous and in the desert. A few venture into grassy areas but they are generally the harmless ones. Scorpians are poorly research locally and here generally hide by day and are quite small so are hard to see. Using a UV light at night is a good way to find them as they are flourescent!! pretty cool. Again more liklely to see them in rural areas or on the beach.  On spiders your likely to find a few harmeless fella around the house, but dont be to hasty to get risd of them as they keep the flying insects in check, same as gecko. In the desert the camel spider is a mean bugger if you get bitten but then you have to be pretty thick as their "cave" and web is pretty obvious.
Q911_C8	we like camping and are we like camping and are hoping to go camping in the desert...would this be advisable with the scorpions etc? Gecko's and lizards we can handle, in fact we have always wanted one inour house! But anything with more than 4 legs....YUgHH!

Q912_C8	spreading the good news is a bad idea Like I said earlier, I heard that both Christians and Hindus had been deported, and that the reason given was that they were trying to convert others.  I think everyone knows that non-muslim, monotheistic religion is tolerated in Qatar, but within boundaries. For example, the churches have been told they may not erect crosses. It seems obvious that if the churches aren't allowed to display crosses, then it's probably forbidden to display crosses, fishes or any other christian symbols on your car.  I think most people also know that trying to convert people is a BIG problem here. Apostasy for a muslim carries a death penalty, and encouraging a muslim to convert to another religion is both cruel and stupid.  If a person makes a complaint to the police about religious activity it will probably be investigated. To avoid trouble, don't carry religious literature around with you. Don't engage people in a conversation about your God unless you know they share the same faith. Don't discuss someone else's God unless you know your audience won't be offended.  For Christians, especially evangelical ones, spreading the good news is part of their religious practice. That practice places people on a collision course with the local authorities. Some people will take the risks on board, and continue to proselytize, but they have no reason to complain when they get kicked out of the country. It is unreasonable to sympathize with those who have been punished for proselytizing, when their activities are risking the lives of those they seek to convert.

Q912_C16	Winn... it goes back to the previous issue If you allow a church to be built in Qatar, then you pretty much have to assume that people are going to worship in it.... regardless of what the mullas say.... the Emir allowed it....    <p> &quot;if you don't like the heat... get out of the kitchen... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave... it will burn you on the a** as you go through the doorway....&quot; ME  </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>visit www.qaws.org
Q912_C17	Bible study Apple, where I come from, bible study is performed by a group of people who study the bible literally as written, it has nothing to do with Christianity, we call "Jehovah witnesses", they use the old testimony, don't think that by attending that meeting, you will have an idea about Christianity, its a sect, not a religion. They meet to read the bible, and explain it without going into spirituality and stuff... Their main objective is to attract you, they do not believe in Jesus as we Christians do.  Anyhow, I believe I went into too much details, its up to you to accept them or not. Also, people are free in their believes, I don't consider that we should express it through gadgets, or crosses, or ... Just pray, and believe.

But they dont believe with popes, and the saints, and they dont believe in such kind of stone image of virgin mary or any saints, they dont even believe that Jesus was the one in the picture with long beard and to my surprise they dont believe in Christmas day was the birth of Jesus? At least that's what I learnt meantime:))  Jehovah Witness? am not sure, never attended yet to any of their gatherings....
Q912_C21	Bible study alot of these gatherings goin on in Qatar. Does it mean they have to be careful from the CID to get deported too?  P/S Arien, its YOU who's hijacking the thread my dear, were talking about religious gatherings in Qatar, but you are talking about me:))) lol!

Q912_C32	I see....Xena Maybe in such a case they will deport people, but if someone just practice their own religion in their own home/privacy, why to deport? they cannot expect to hired all Muslims?  Like in my case, there are some born again friends who tried to invite me for a so called Bible studies. I told them i'm cool with that coz it doesn't cause me any harm and I'd like to understand their beliefs. But next time I'm inviting them in my religion too to understand mine.

Q912_C44	Amoud Your comment is not for me, apologies for this.   But I think its just like hanging a small Qur'an or a "mishba" in our car, we felt protected. Its part of their belief.
Q912_C45	lol! arien ahh hmmm wait... let me check Mr. Webster;)
Q912_C46	Nicaq25 I'm not sure with others, but if you ask me as a Muslim?....sure I can relate with you guys. I still feel its very injustice to deport anyone due to religious belief unless he/she tried to convert any Muslim in that country coz just like Ngourly said, he/she will put someone's lives at risk by doing that.   Though, personally I have no problem w/ someone preaching and trying to convert me coz I have my own faith which is strong in I believe. So long the person who preaches me wont stop me from practicing my own belief, then I'm cool with that.
Q912_C47	personally, I don't believe in conversion because there are factors that makes me skeptical of the people convincing me. I'd rather more likely to be convinced on the testimony of one person's life.That is practicing your faith in your daily life. For me by just reading the bible literally, doesn't make me see God. But I can see & feel God through people, ordinary people. I think that's the real essence of being christian or being one that believes there is only ONE GOD, ONE CREATOR.He maybe called in many names depends on which part of the universe we are, but I guess HE is still the ONE.
Q912_C48	Amoud I was serious to answer you too.   I am putting a small Qur'an in my car because of its content. In my belief some aya's and doa'a in it will able to help me shoo away shaytan and be safe travelling. Do u mean I shouldn't believe it or does it makes me shirk? Kindly enlightened me? Tnx:)
Q912_C49	So Apple, dont you think So Apple, dont you think that reading while you drive to protect yourself is a bit of a contradiction? You dont need to memorize them all, there are specific ayas and duas as you said, and if memory serves me correctly, you recite the Ayat al Kursi for safe travel.   ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q912_C50	OK, so I am trying to get a OK, so I am trying to get a definative answer.   You said you keep it in the car to protect you, then you said you keep it because there are some ayas and duas to read to keep you safe. YOu said you keep it because you cant remember these ayas and duas, so logically to use them to keep you safe while driving you would have to be reading them right?   Means I still have got no clear answer why this protects you in the car. ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q915	Getting Car Lisence After 2012 or 13 After 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21.is this true..
Q915_C1	It will be a good idea, if It will be a good idea, if implemented but I will personally suggest it should be 22 yrs. I have seen very young drivers driving Land Cruisers like a plane and they think like the others are like ants on the road.
Q915_C2	the gossip we are hearing the gossip we are hearing from almost 1 years. but it's not so strong idea. because the young people will drive without license if they not provide at 18 years age. than it will be more problem for them as well as for us. better give them correct driving skills so that they will be careful as well as all of us. most of the reckless driver(young) you see on the road are having license after 1/2 or more years their driving without license!!!
Q915_C3	It has nothing to do with age! The only thing that can stop these reckless drivers is more radars and to increase the number of black points to 5 or 6 when they exceed the limit set on the particular street.
Q915_C4	Do not forget higher fines Do not forget higher fines for traffic violations. The one thing that seems to open their eyes is a heavy drain on their pocket books
Q915_C5	Confiscate the car... Hope there was some system to confiscate the car of the reckless driver, and should be given a smaller car to drive for some days... Even I wondered how it would be if some policemen are deployed to survey the road (drive thru a strech of road) along with cameras, in smaller civilian cars to see and catch the culprits easily !

I didnt see your profile and I dont know what nationality you are, any how  back in Sri lanka there are so many Ayurvedic doctors for fracture  related treatments. its quite unbeleivalbe the power of herbs. I my self fractured my leg and it was treated by an Ayurvediv doctor.  Recently my son all of sudden who started limping and we found out that one of his legs is longer than the other and tried with many doctors (we call it english medicine there) and many XRays, MRI's and tests and so on but no body could even diagnose the problem.  Then it was Ayurvedic treatment, The AW dr Said it will take some time and your son has to be admitted in my hospital I agreed and we stayed exactly on month. Again the miracle of herbs with gods willing he was cured and he is perfectly alright now.   sorry it must be boaring, any how its magic of Ayurvedic medicines

Q927	short course on basics of photography? do you know someone who is offering a short course on basics of photography?
Q927_C1	RE: short course on basics of photography? join a group of photography enthusiast and you'll be able to learn not just basic course... try this... http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography
Q927_C2	RE: short course on basics of photography? Education.. if you find one, please let me know.. my husband and I would love to join!!
Q927_C3	RE: short course on basics of photography? I really need to start charging for my courses - I could make a fortune! QL have a regular informal get together every second Tuesday where we take pictures and chat about photography. Last week I gave a small group a lesson on the basics.  I suggest as a start point you join the QL Photography group and search through it's topics as there are some good links to photo basics there.  Click here: http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography  And on particular, click here: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/226360
Q927_C4	RE: short course on basics of photography? Well...all i can say is photography is all about creativeness and a few camera parameters to keep yourself well aware of. I bought my first Canon Powershot SX100 IS and shot a few really amazing photos just by reading the manual. Most people who are unable to use a gadget properly are either sick of reading manuals or careless enough to use it in "AUTO" mode.   A camera has 4 main parameters to adjust while taking pictures of subjects in different light and movement conditions, viz: Shutter Speed, ISO, Exposure Time and Aperture Value.  Read about how these parameters work together on the internet and you'd know how close you're to becoming a photographer. Joining a course to master the skills sound ridiculous to me. The choice is yours anyway. Cheers!
Q928	Plasma or LCD? LCD or Plasma TV?  I beleive plasma is better for cable and sat tv?  There is a good samsound 42inch plasma in carrefour, lulu and virigin.  series 4 42A410 i think it is.  Qr3979  Good buy?
Q928_C1	RE: Plasma or LCD? Buy Philips, Sony, Hitachi, Panasonic but DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. Samsung TVs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 years.  I do agree, nothing matches the picture quality but it is good if you are planing the TV for a short term.
Q928_C2	RE: Plasma or LCD? If you're in the market for a big screen television like 50  50-inches and above -- then i'd suggest plasma as a safe bet. Plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town, and while LCDs can give you better resolution, plasma still has the edge in terms of picture quality. One other thing to look for, whether you opt for plasma or LCD, is an integrated tuner -- many TVs still have analogue tuners, which look pretty terrible on a large screen. Try to get a model with an inbuilt HD tuner if you can.   At the smaller end of things (15" to 42" TVs), LCD is the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful.
Q928_C3	RE: Plasma or LCD? I would go for LCD
Q928_C4	RE: Plasma or LCD? LCD hands down. In almost everyway, lcd wins, it is superior. if movies look bad on satellite, it the decoders fault. You might also look into NOT USING COMPOSITE CABLES as they make it useless to own a HD tv. use vga, dvi or hdmi.  Using a component cable for a hd tv, is worse than buying a ferarri, without any gas. yes its that pointless.
Q928_C5	RE: Plasma or LCD? LCD is a better choice.
Q928_C6	RE: Plasma or LCD? i go for plasma. unless you will be using the blue ray or blu ray recorded then you may able to watch the most cosmetized picture of all. LCD may give you the clearest picture of all but as far as true color realism is concern for me plasma is the best.

Q936	Job offer in Cambridge school Hi everyone, I recently got a job offer in the Cambridge school and I need a feedback about that college: the environment, the ambiance, how do they treat their stuff, the salaries... I really need your advices. I'll be thankful. Does anyone work there?
Q936_C1	You haven't stated is it the You haven't stated is it the international school or girl's school however both don't have a good reputation especially the girl's school. They are not good to their staff, have loads of after school meetings that aren't productive and a waste of time. Teacher's could use that time more productively for class prep etc.Salary depends on your nationality. If I were you I wouldn't accept a position their!
Q936_C2	I was a student at Cambridge I was a student at Cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation is now but I can honestly say it was one of the worst schools at that time   The student behavior is horrible. So horrible that they had to bring in like 10 security guards and put in cameras all over the school  The teachers were mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking positions but head of security(an arabic lady) was basically ruling the school.Even the teachers were scared of her.   This is obviously a students perspective from two years ago so dont take it too seriously   If i had to list all it's faults the character limit will be passed

Q936_C4	Thank you all for your Thank you all for your advices... You scared me actually! I thought that it was a good school since it's "Cambridge"!! It's surprising that most of the stuff are Indians...
Q936_C5	Do NOT go there, a close Do NOT go there, a close friend of mine works there so I get all of the stories all bad ones, the Indian regime, the attitude is horrible, if you have been offered a job there then you are highly likley to be offered somewhere else, the cheapest possible air fare home routing through Dubai overnight, the delayed salary in July, paid in September so you will return etc,etc,etc
Q936_C6	There are a lot of schools There are a lot of schools who use words like "Cambridge" "Oxford" "American" "British" "International"  I can open a school called the International New York School for Fine Arts and none of those words have any relationship to the type of school I operate.  Good for you for asking here first.

Q939_C7	Its all about the NOC. Did your brother get a NOC (certificate or letter?)
Q939_C8	to visit me only... previous employer assured him get the NOC , but the question is he is not coming for employment, he is coming to visit me only under my sponshership.
Q939_C9	Send an official Salam IQ755,  Send an official letter requesting them to issue an NOC letters to apply for family visit visa under your sponsorship and to exempt him from two-year ban (in case your brother was employed less than 2 years). Attached your passport and RP copies; and so his passport and RP cancellatin page copies.  Further, there is no harm if he will be backed here for visit or work or whatever legitimate purpose he intents. It's a basic human right to earn his living or conduct his private legal business. No one can bar you from that so just be honest with his previous employer to avoid a can of worms.  Knowing Technip, I don't think they will hold any issue against your brother for his visit or work again here in Qatar unless your brother has a lingering bad reputation.  Hope the above helps.
Q939_C10	Assalaamualaikum wa Assalaamualaikum wa Rahmatullah: sixroomvilla.  Thanks for the good advice.. means i have to send a letter to his previous employer requesting for NOC for visit visa under my sponsership. Right!!

Q941	I wanna know Hello every body here , Is here in Doha any diplomatic office or  Consulate for Australia ? because I wanna apply for visa to go there this year , thanks
Q941_C1	As far as I know You can apply online for a Visit Visa, for any nationality.  In fact, all nationalities now have to have a Visa prior to entry. Used to be OK for Commonwealth, then they changed it to only New Zealand, and now, even the Kiwi's need a Visa.  I can tell you, whatever you do, DONT try to take food in, as they are extremely strict. Another trick to avoid huge delay's at the airport is to declare something. That way, they are happy, and will, relatively speaking, leave you alone. If you dont declare things, and get picked out for inspection, you will be there for ages.  Love my country, but it is a total pain travelling to and fro, even as a citizen.  And, Qatar does not have an Embassy or Consul here. You need to go to the near useless Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Three times I have tried to get very simple things done, and all three times failed.
Q941_C2	I would love to visit I would love to visit Australia some day INSHAALLAH.

Q947	Will pregnancy affect employment offer My friend's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.Today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.Will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too.
Q947_C1	Depends on the company.  But Depends on the company.  But I doubt if the offer will go through.
Q947_C2	LP whats the comparison between pregnant women and idiots ??? LOL :)
Q947_C3	Speaking as a pregnant woman, Speaking as a pregnant woman, sometimes we can be idiots.  Around the third trimester you'd forget your own head if it wasn't attached to you.
Q947_C4	I think its not a problem, I think its not a problem, but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr...
Q947_C5	Normally pregnancy is not Normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance. Esp in the govt sector here in doha. But better to mention orally before the tests go through. Honesty never fails!
Q947_C6	Looking at it from an HR Looking at it from an HR point of view, she's not a good investment.  First of all she'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months (for doctors appts. sick leave, etc) as well as 54 days of maternity leave, and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim.    I wouldn't hire her.
Q947_C7	As per experience, yes it As per experience, yes it will surely affects her job offer. I am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before, and its one of the policy that they can't hire a pregnant women even in some govt & private offices that i've known. Their reasons: 1st, they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy. 2nd, they will probably thought that you cannot exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes, body pains etc, and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant. 3rd: ur medical results will be stamped as UNFIT to work if found out that your pregnant... So the best thing, if your planning to look for work, dont get pregnant, but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work (bec. that's 2 different case)...
Q947_C8	Even with the smiley face Even with the smiley face  that is harsh prism :-p, not true for many many pregnant women, but mm is right too. Anyway, even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster, pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front.  Coming to the op, if the medical is already over, then nothing really to worry about, except probation may go longer, once they know the employee is pregnant. If medical is not complete yet, and if the candidate is really required by the company, then a temporary job offer may be presented to her, and only when she returns back from her maternity leave, will her job become permanent. It all depends upon their hr policies.
Q947_C9	Will pregnancy affect employment offer agreed with Arlene advised, its all country ruling not to hire pregnant unless nobodies qualified for the post in the country or the applicant is a scientest.
Q947_C10	I wish her all the best, I wish her all the best,
Q947_C11	han19...I didnt mean to be han19...I didnt mean to be harsh... just stated reality from a corporates POV...for idiots I think there is no issue...for pregnant women coming on board afresh, other women have already elaborated on it....and smiley was just to soften the pinch of reality...:)   But still if it sounds harsh my apologies to whomever it may concern, as it was unintentional.
Q947_C12	If she receives a job offer If she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away, then she may file a claim for discrimination. I don't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system.  But if she gets hired, her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave, during the 50-day maternity leave period. For more details, read Art. 96 of the Labour Law (see below)  "A female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days. Such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days."
Q947_C13	2012 Olympics, I have worked 2012 Olympics, I have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and I can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy.
Q947_C14	Maybe they can.  But your Maybe they can.  But your view is not the view of most employers here.
Q947_C15	In my similar yrs of working In my similar yrs of working under, along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant... the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant (every year)...finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons.
Q947_C16	Well, 2012 Olympics, the way Well, 2012 Olympics, the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective AS an employer.  Testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination. I cannot argue whether is legal or not in this country, but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue.  Prism, I know what you're talking about, but it's a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control, ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures. We all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason.
Q947_C17	after the medical check-up after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it's the employer decision.  if the employer is ok with that, they have no problem to accept you and process your papers

Q949	traffic viloation. I have a traffic violation and I need to travel for a business meeting.  Do I need to pay it before applying for an exit permit or it is ok I will just pay it once i will renew my car registration? Thanks
Q949_C1	RE: traffic viloation. I did the same, after I came back from vacation and went in for renewal of car registration I had to pay a penalty for paying the fine late, I had to pay some sixty riyals extra other than the fine which was five hundred, so better sort it out as quick as u can, good luck

Now I am charged 1000 QAR.  Will this give me any problem to get my exit permit?
Q949_C3	RE: traffic viloation. If you are thinking of challenging this fine then, wait until you comeback from your trip. Otherwise it take only a few minutes to pay the traffic fine, please settle the fine before travel and be free for all worries.
Q949_C4	RE: traffic viloation. If it is the Red signal jumping ( QR. 6000 )  it is better to pay and visit. Otherwise, for smaller amounts, they will allow you to go out of Airport, YOu may pay later

Q951	Need your advice on Kahramaa I am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords. This means I'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one, is this something you can do in a single step process? If you have done this before, what is the best way of doing it?
Q951_C1	I dont think it is a single I dont think it is a single step process. Your new apartment will have a meter and a number given by Kahrmaa. you  will need to have that no when u go to Kahrmaa and also the receipt which was given to you when you paid the adv for the current house.  You will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer. But you need to let them know when you are shifting so that they can give you the connection before you shift.  I guess thats about it. its all i did when i shifted but that was in 2006. i doubt if much has changed but here you never know. also have copies of your rp, passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement.
Q951_C2	find kahrama office service depending on you area .. find kahrama office service depending on you area .. you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one .. not two birds in one shot .. cancellation procedures : 1- take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both ..  2-fill up the form of cancellation  3- copies of your identity cards 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip (2000)QR then they will calculate your balance and issue check QNB or you have to pay in case your previous payments exceeds the limit of 2000 QR advanced,  next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you applied first time ... goodluck :))

After birth take father and mother passprot copy and marriage certificate. if born in hamad hospital it is quiet easy. If not (doha/ al ahalia clinic then get birth notification from the hospital) and go to the birth registration office(next to lulu center,opp hamad clinic) and produce the letter in ground floor reception along with marriage certificate, parents passport and RP copy. By the time you can also get child vacination card. After that they will ask you to go to third floor. The will ask father and mother RP and qualification certificate. give it in 3rd floor and pay in ground floor. according to number of copies you will pay. after a week you can collect it.Later take it to embassy and get BIRTH CERTIFICATE from them and apply for passport. After getting passport you can also apply and get RP.

Q956_C6	RE: Gender Friendly Hotels Just book it in one of your names, and then later have the other person jump on the elevator and join you upstairs.  Be discreet, take precautions, but it can be done.    If you're caught/confronted, claim you're married and that you just don't have the paperwork on hand to prove it.  Be outraged and indignant...especially if you're both western, this usually works.   They really only care if one of you is Asian/Arab, or if as a couple you're being really overt and in your face about things, lots of PDA's etc.  Loads of guys here (locals and expats) book hotel rooms and manage to use them with a prostitute or with their regular girlfriend...

Q957_C6	RE: which is the best 4wd ? If you budget is 60,000-70,000 then better go for Pajero, as you can get a good condition Pajero 2007-2008 model. But if you are planning for sand dunes, then Pajero is not an ideal car. You have to look for Land Cruiser or Patrol.
Q957_C7	RE: which is the best 4wd ? 4Wheel drive for what purpose? If you want to use for daily commuting, all 4WD are goood. All depends on your budget. For serious off-roading, go for Jeep Wrangler. If you are looking for just size and comfort, better you should look for after sale support, ease of spare availability, easy to maintain and easy to sell. In this catagory only Toyota and Nissan would be best choice.

Q980	wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden.. no embassy in Qatar Hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden? where did you apply for the visa?  I haven't  got insurance, Is it necessary in the supporting documents?
Q980_C1	RE: wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden.. no... Hi,  I believe all Schengen visa applications are dealt with via the German Embassy in Doha.  Probably best to check their website for further details.  Best of luck.
Q980_C2	RE: wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden.. no... I think Swedish Embassy is in Kuwait. There was a thread in QL earlier in 2010 regareding this issue (do a search). You may call and ask them or you may check with the Embassies of other Schengen countries (France, Germany etc.) for further details. I dont think you need insurance documents for applying the visa.
Q980_C3	RE: wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden.. no... you can apply for schengen visa through any other schengen countries (France, Germany - pretty much all of the EU countries) although apparently they all have different rules, so look around. I assume you will be catching a flight through another EU country anyways, so just have to have a stop over probably. good luck!
Q980_C4	RE: wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden.. no... No need of having Swiss Embassy to get Shengen Visa.  You can use services of German Embassy to get this. It is in Bin Omran.... Opposit side of Ahli Hospital,, the road near Salaam HO.  ( i dont know they changed location )

Q981_C1	RE: My wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better... 8 months is not tooo much i think... but anyway u can consult a doctor , i suggest Dr.Khudsiya Beegum , alwaab street (khalifa stadium)  You need to go there to get register for first time, the clinc timings are 8:00 AM to 12:00 noon then from 16:00 to 20:00 from Surterday to Thursday. contact: 44475969
Q981_C2	RE: My wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better... If you are taking alcohol or tobacco, cut down. Get yourself free from any stress. Winter is coming. Do not loose hope.
Q981_C3	RE: My wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better... I advice to go to Hamad hospital...  As Khudsia Begum is not the best doctor. Just this site makes good advertising for her... Being in emergency situation I did not get any help from her... Just was re-directed to Hamad... But their money they take accurately. So I do not trust any private hospitals.   For the money they charge at Dr. Khudsia's clinics they could at least provide the tissues and soap in ladys' WC....
Q981_C4	RE: My wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better... you need basic investigations that can be done with any gynaec dr.even dr.beegum is ok for that.

Q985_C2	RE: Can anyone give me idea Dear friend,  I have lived in UAE for more than 12 years and an year back only shifted to Doha, Qatar.  Of all the 7 emirates, in terms of house rents,  Abu Dhabi is considered to be the most expensive but Al Ain being less populated, the price you pay for a two bedroom ordinary flat, you may get a 3 bedroom villa in Al Ain.That too, due to recession effect, the prices are expected to be slashed.  The schools are also easy to get admission due to the same reason of less populated area.  A quite place but you will  get easy access to all basic amenities, like shops, taxi stands.  Even the taxi fare is comparatively less than other Emirates esp Dubai. Hope this information was useful to you. If I come across some more significant info, will definitely post it or will PM you.  Regards,

Q1000	Where can I find Computer Hardware where can I find hardware computer shop? It is not selling computer as a whole. or laptops, (not like jarir or carefour). I want to know where i can get hardware thing like motherboard, Ram, CPU, etc. Please tell me where it exactly is and what the name is. I have found some but it is not big as I thought it would be. can you show me what is the biggest one and nearly every component brands is there? Thanks very much.
Q1000_C1	RE: Where can I find Computer Hardware Near najada  sofitel
Q1000_C2	RE: Where can I find Computer Hardware hi sofitel is the best place for computer spare parts
Q1000_C3	RE: Where can I find Computer Hardware Except for the case and power supply (expensive shipping due to weight), it might be cheaper to source other parts through Amazon w/ Aramex shop n ship.
Q1000_C4	RE: Where can I find Computer Hardware Oops sorry, a fault. Delete the 2 post above please. Thx :)  I have found a store called 'tornado' store and it's on the sofitel area man. It's a good store with Processors, RAM, Motherboard, Graphic Cards, Casing, etc and even up to Corsair H80. But the problem is that they don't have Good Quality Power Supply (Antec, Seasonic, Corsair, etc) They only have Gigabyte and Cooler Master :(. I'm looking forward if there is a better store and It would be really good if you show me what is it's name and where it is exactly. But if no then I should order the parts that are not available there :(.
Q1000_C5	RE: Where can I find Computer Hardware Yea that Gigabyte store is one of the best around here (the one just opposite sofitel / mercure grand). You'll not find an antec, seasonic in here.   I waited for 6 months for a scheduled business trip to dubai to pick up an antec earthwatts. Picked it up on Bur Dubai. There is a place similar to sofitel / mercure grand ... just more bigger and better (don't remember which one, but all the taxi folks know it)..

Q1013_C1	Honestly if you can do the Honestly if you can do the applications alone the lawyers arent any faster. You just have to be persistant. Lawyers will tell you that they have a special arrangmenet but it is baloney.    "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q1013_C2	Thanks for the info Thanks for the info amoud,,is it really so? howabout going thru the consultancy office?
Q1013_C3	doesn't matter what you are doesn't matter what you are going through! Canada Immigration officer doesn't care about it. He/She is strictly following the procedure, rules and instructions. and by the way this is the first thing you guys have to learn about canada. You have to be loyal and law obedient and rules respectful. No fooling around, no playing games, no middle-eastern tricks and focus-pocuses! If you have gained enough points on six factors, you become eligible to APPLY for the Immigration. It doesnt make you a Permanent Resident automatically though.   <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed. Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i>   <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
Q1013_C4	that's right you really dont need a lawyer to apply for immigration to canada though its ok to hire one... just look for people who have gone through it to guide you in filling up the forms and of course you have to do your own reading...i found out late so better get all the info in their website:  http://www.cic.gc.ca
Q1013_C5	greentea, it's not greentea, it's not necessary, but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful! Sometimes everything goes smooth and easy. Sometimes there are hidden problems on the way. Filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process. On the other hand, if the information provided in the application form is correct and TRUTHFUL, and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process, it shouldnt be any issue with that.. but sometimes some unpredictable things happen.. here is the example.  5 points are given for the relatives in Canada. Lets say the applicant has a sister who possesses a Resident status in Canada. While filling in the application, the applicant adds 5 points to his score, and it helps him to get 67 points. But.. once the Immigration Office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application. And then it turns out, that a sister doesnt live in Canada at all. She lives, lets say in her home country, Lebanon. And guess what, these 5 points for sister in Canada are taken out of the applicant's score.  And then the applicant is left with only 62 points, which are not enough for the status of Immigrant. The case is refused and closed. This is only an example. There are a lot of different things and different issues.  But again, if applicant is honest, and everything is clear and not doubtful, it shouldnt be any problems..   I met one guy who wants to immigrate.. when I asked him what kind of education does he have, he said: high school. I said: there is no any chance for you. He said: oh, its not a problem.. I can get any Diploma, Degree, Certificates you want. I said: I dont WANT you to get anything. I dont want you to immigrate to Canada with this kind of moral norms, at the first place.   <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed. Antoine de Saint-Exupry </b> </i>   <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
Q1013_C6	Honesty on the application Honesty on the application is a different matter. Thats down to morals and common sense.   A lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful. If you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site. If any questions arise the embassy will call you. Also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews, these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries.   A lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $. Totally not worth it, Just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying.   "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q1013_C7	on my part QS my lawyer gave me the forms to fill up then send him back the forms and the documents to go with it. later he met me again to review the filled up forms (in adobe format this time) then if entries are correct and no changes made, i signed it then send it back to him again. after a few months, he send me the file number. that's it for 2 years i did not hear from him again. i just have to check the website for the status of my application using my file number. the next time i heard from him, he advised me to download again the same forms from the website and fill it up, sign, follow the list of exhibits to be submitted that are not yet submitted earlier then submit direct to high commission of canada within 90 days from the date the letter was issued. good thing i made a photocopy of my original documents to avoid discrepancies. so basically, in the end you still have to send updated forms direct to the high commission
Q1013_C8	tipu sultan I am an expert in a lot of issues.. just lazy to express my knowledge, opinions and thoughts.. LOL.. You have to live in Canada 3 years out of 4 to be eligible to apply for the Citizenship. It means if you dont leave Canada for 3 years at all, then you can apply.. in case you go back and forth, you have to collect 1095 days during 4 years. You wont be able to apply for the citizenship, until you collect 1095 days during last 4 years..   <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q1013_C9	I agree 100% Qatarisun, the I agree 100% Qatarisun, the forms in all are a bit complicated but I must say the lawyer does nothing. I can mail a letter for crying out loud   "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"
Q1013_C10	greentea of course you have to send the UPDATED forms again! 2 years have passed!! a lot of changes in your life may occur in 2 years! You might get married, and your educated husband will get extra points, which will make your case stronger. Or other way around, you get divorced and your husband is no longer in your application..and his points disappear along with him.. :) ..Or you had a baby, and you want to include her/him into your application...life is going on.. that's why it's normal to ask for the current information which is up to date.. ..but for you it's good news. it means you are getting closer.. :)  <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q1013_C11	dont need a lawyer You can apply through follwing site... http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp

Q1013_C14	It depends tipu. Are you It depends tipu. Are you married to a Canadian Citizen? If you are married to a Canadian and are accompanying them abroad you are fine. If not I would seriously check your Residence status as you can not fulfil your 2 year obligation and have stayed out of the country for more than 6 months. This needs to be answered by an immigration official.   "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"

Q1013_C16	Immigration representatives Immigration representatives are people who offer immigration advice or assistance to visa applicants, usually for a fee.  You do not need to hire an immigration representative. It is up to you. The Government of Canada treats everyone equally, whether they use the services of a representative or not.  If you choose to hire a representative, your application will not be given special attention by the immigration officer. Your representative also cannot guarantee that your application will be approved.  All the forms and information that you need to apply for a visa are available for free on this website. If you follow the instructions in the application guide, you can complete the application forms and submit them on your own.  http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/representative/index.asp  In this modern world, internet is the greate qualizer.

Q1048_C10	Dunestock The last I heard it has been moved to November. I think after summer would be a little too hot. November should be cool. I hope they give enough advance notification for Auditions this year.   With the Quad bikes issue being reduced last year (compared to 2007) underage youth playing loud Rap music and getting drunk was a rather disturbing site. Too obvious to miss the fact they were not there for the music. This creates an unwanted nuisance for Dune stockers with families and loyal dune stockers who have been present since it came into existance.  As I musician, it put me down a bit. I missed civil defense I.e. Police patrolling the area like the year before. That will automatically reduce "Underage" activities taking place.. (or atleast in the open public)  I am also aware the there has always been an issue with volunteers backing out at the end moment. I think getting a group of loyal mature musicians and music fans (period) from QL to help support Dunestock would be a great idea. I think at events like these, its almost common sense that they need all the support they can get..  oh well...just a thought....  Rock n' Roll..

Q1053	New Qatar Income Tax Law Hi friends,  I am working with an international company where the new income tax law is to be implemented. Could you please help me with the following? 1) How your companies reacted to withholding taxes  Thanks My Blessings.
Q1053_C1	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law Dear Salah,  Is this 5% withholding tax can be refunded by non-resident company? Do you have idea when it comes to filing and payment? And where to file?  Thanks in advance.
Q1053_C2	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law withholding applies only to companies that have no entity in Qatar.(no Commercial Register)  I think it's fair as those companies don't have expensis nor support the local economy.
Q1053_C3	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law Currently new law is put on Hold!   Suggest to check online at Ministry of Finance website for detail tax presentation and E&Y or KPMG Tax consultants for latest update.
Q1053_C4	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law you cannot withold paying taxes unless you are a 100% qatari owned company.
Q1053_C5	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law Dear Salah,  My understanding is that withholding tax is applicable all the international transfers they don't have a Permanent establishment here.  That means if we are transferring funds to Head Office we should have withhold.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Thanks
Q1053_C6	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law Dear Victory,  I didnt know that...; Let me check with E&Y. They are also our Auditors. Anyway thanks a lot for the replay.
Q1053_C7	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law Victory kindly give me the Link of the website.please
Q1053_C8	RE: New Qatar Income Tax Law u should understand the difference between withholding and actual taxes.  As per the law which came in effect on 1/1/2010, for those companies that are doing work in the country without being registered / don't have CR/ the owner of the contract will withhold either 5% or 7% (depends on the activity)of the total payment on monthly basis.  This amount will be paid to the tax authority before the 15th of the following month.  In my opinion, this is to encourage foreign companies to establish a base office in the country.

Q1063	Any Qatari Labour Laws experts who can help please? Under Qatari Labour laws, a company (especially a government organization) terminating an expatriate staff (who has worked for the company for over 5 years) is required to pay two (2) extra months' salary at the end?  I got only one extra month's salary!
Q1063_C1	RE: Any Qatari Labour Laws experts who can help please? there is no specific provision on the labor law which states your claim unless there is an agreement between you and your company. the end of service gratuity is 3 weeks pay for every year of service.  Article (54)  In addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service, the  employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of  one year or more. This gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties, provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment. The worker shall be entitled to gratuity for  the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment.  The worker's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those  stipulated in article (61) of this Law and is returned to service within two months of its termination.  The last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity.  The employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker.
Q1064	Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. I have a friend whose father cheated with other woman. Now we have evidence for their relationship.  What should we do about it? Should we report to Qatar Police or our Embassy?   If we report, will they be deported from Qatar, lost job and must back to their original country? What the best solution for this...?  Any QL member, can give us idea..   Thank you very much
Q1064_C1	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. You need to have strong evidence to support ur case... ask your friend if he/she wants his father to be deported along with his partner. If found guilty he might have to serve a jail term before being deported.... i dont think embassy will entertain such cases. U can take help from the police.
Q1064_C2	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. She should talk to his Father , to clarify this issue,before anything else.

Q1064_C6	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. Thats quite a balancing act to be done by your friend before he needs to report to the authority. Lets suppose that your friend is totally dependant on his father to support his family financially then there will be no choice to loose him out. The best option is to talk to the father to advise him what he did was morally wrong and if he has a strong religious back ground, than that would be an advantage to convince him out
Q1064_C7	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. Mind your own business and don't interfere in other's family matters.
Q1064_C8	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. There's always 3 sides to a story - his side, her side and reality. So, as the others said - better let things be sorted out privately or the repercussions could be so much greater, affecting you also. Think further before you act.
Q1064_C9	RE: Father affair Issue with other woman, please help.. Friendly speaking, it's good for you because you care for your friend. However, you have to consider the consequences before making any action. You may worsen the situation or somewhat solve the problem. In my opinion, as a friend don't ever interfere on a family matters. Perhaps, you can advise your friend how to deal with it and solve the issue internally without involving the authorities.godbless

Q1065	Is having Israeli visa stamp a problem? I would like to tour Qatar for a couple of days next month. I have an Israeli visa stamp in my passport when I visited Jerusalem from Amman in August 2008. Can I still get a tourist visa at Doha airport upon arrival? I have a US passport. I know Doha hosted an Israeli trade office, but I heard its been closed since the Gaza war. Thanks!
Q1065_C1	It could be a problem...not sure what to tell you. Last I heard (and from everything I have read about Qatar) was that officially stamps from Israel in your passport were a big no-no.   That said, I don't know that they check for it really -- maybe more bark than bite.  The Israeli trade office closed in January...

Q1068_C1	Police clearance from country Police clearance from country of origin and country of residence. Having NOC doesnt mean that he will be able to change jobs. That is at the hands of the immigration to approve or deny.

Q1069_C4	thanks for that thanks hannah981
Q1069_C5	some people tell me right, some people tell me you can get sma in megamart but it wasnt there today- things are like that here - when they are they buy lots cos it may not be there again. In carrefour they had semilac, nestle, aptamil, pediasure ensure and wyeth. On the Sma website it links to wyeth- I dont know if they are made by the same company but apparently they are equivalent. If you google sma and the countries it is in it directs you to wyeth for some countries including qatar. These brands all seem to be readily available in the shops and were in a few different shops so should be easy to get hold of. If you research SMA maybe it is the same as the wyeth?? If your little one has to have sma and the link with wyeth goes nowhere then I would ship it but it'll be fairly expensive. I guess the only alternative is to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here?  Wish you all the best with the move and the baby. My research is just testament to how bored I am as I have not yet found a job. I am also in healthcare and it seems hard for westerners to get those kind of jobs here!

To get a feel for his audience, he asks: "How many people here believe in ghosts?" About 90 students raise their hands. "Well, thats a good start. Out of those who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you have seen a ghost?" About 40 students raise their hands.. "Thats really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?" About 15 students raise their hands.. "Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?" 3 students raise their hands... "Thats fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?" Way in the back, MarcoNandoz-01 raises his hand. The professor takes off his glasses and says: "Son all the years I've beee giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience." Middle Eastern MarcoNandoz-01 replied with a nod and a grin, and began to make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the room, the professor asks: "So MarcoNandoz-01, tell us what its like to have sex with a ghost?"  MarcoNandoz-01 replied: "Oh Shyte, from way back there, i thought you said Goats"

Q1092_C23	Well, strange spirits have Well, strange spirits have been apart of out family for some time. They are very helpful to us. lol I have never experienced these spirits myself but specific family members have repeatedly spoken about their encounters.   1. Grandmother was about to be hit by a bus. And 'somebody' picked her up and moved her out of the way. Turned around to say thanks but mysteriously no one was there.  2. Grandmother again when she was a child was in her room when a fire started. Freaked out as she was a strange spirit (what she thought was an angel) came down and told her' "Don't be afraid." And she calmed down and she sat down not being afraid. Until her father came breaking down the door screaming like "What the hell is the matter with you!!!" But she just said, "I am not afraid." :D  3. Great Grandmother was about to touch a high voltage wire until she sees this 'angel' spirit sitting right in front of it!   4. My Aunt is a little different hers are more like freaky strange spirits not as helpful as the others. :D Her's are more disturbing the peace by shutting and slamming doors randomly around the house.    And many more of other stories of such experiences. Some are indeed friendly ghosts though! :D

Q1092_C29	n_minie, a haunted house may n_minie, a haunted house may induce some fear in people but frankly I would love to spend a night there. It would be a lifetime experience...either way.  During our college days, a junior female student committed suicide in a lake which was inside our college campus. For many months after the incident some of us tried to go there late nights if her ghost would tell us the real story!! Well, we were not matured then and we seriously thought we could solve this case talking to her ghost. Now I laugh at myself for being so stupid.

Q1099_C3	Buy tickets for the Buy tickets for the hop-on/hop-off open top buses -you can  get on and off as much as you want and there are 4 different tour routes so you can see almost all of the best sites for a reasonable price.I can recommend the Royal Magda Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe- small but spotlessly clean. Climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe for a fantastic view of the Champs Elysses and Paris-it's better than the view from the Eiffel Tower. Beware of pickpockets and scam artists particularly in the Sacre Coeur area. Keep your wallet under your shirt next to your body.Have a great trip. >  May your dreams take you travelling all through your life.
Q1099_C4	When arriving in Paris you When arriving in Paris you can take the Air France shuttle bus into Paris from the airport and it will drop off at the Arc de Triomphe where you can get ataxi to your accomodation.Its cheaper and safer than taking a taxi or the metro.>  May your dreams take you travelling all through your life.

Q1099_C6	I recommend you visit Louvre I recommend you visit Louvre Museum to see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt..very interesting stuff though...  For food, try Noura restaurant for fine Arabic food..two branches, one in Chapms Elysee and the the other one off the Opera station...  La Defense is another nice place for walking and wondering about..  Try also the latin square and the Arabic cultural centre which has interesting history remarks..it is also close the the Bastil...  Eiffel Tower is nice but don't climb it if you have heights phobia..surroundings is enough beauty..  Don't go to Pigale area at night..it becomes unstable..  I am sure you heard of De Triumph Arch so don't miss it..you can get up to its top..nice for fotos..  Have a safe journey..

Q1099_C9	2 days were enoguh for me My husband & I went there for 2 days by train from Switzerland (part from our honeymoon). and I found out 2 days were enough and won't go there again. We've stayed at Hotel Plaza Athenee, which has a view of the Eiffel Tower. It was lovely & it is the same hotel that Sarah Jessica Parker stayed in in one of "Sex & the city" episodes.  Of course going on top of Eiffel Tower is great. and we went there early in the morning to avoid the long lines.  also: * Louvre * Arc de Triomphe * Versai Palace * Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris * old down town Paris * If you have kids 1 day in Disneyland, otherwise I don't recommend it. * A walk in the Champs-Elysees street. which has number of cafe's & restaurants. make sure to stand in the middle of the street & take picture of the Arc de Triomphe  I always do a research on Yahoo travels. there are lots of useful reviews and recommendations for hotels, things to do & restaurants.

Q1099_C10	My tips having been to Paris twice now.  1.  Buy a guide book--they have several at Jarir or Virgin.  2.  Agree with above poster:        A. Sacre Coeur better than Notre Dame.  I also         like Saint Chapelle better, which is only          about a block from Notre Dame.      B. Metro is fabulous      C. Lourve is huge, just run to your favorites           and skip the  rest.      D. I enjoyed Versailles,  especially the grounds.      E. Eiffel Tower lines can be long or short            depending on day and time.  If super long,          then leave and come back later.      F.  Walk around in the Jardin des Tuileries.

Q1099_C16	You should plan it very well You should plan it very well so that you don't waste any of your time there. Search in the internet what places in Paris would be very interesting for you. I suggest,t he best place to view Eiffel Tower is in Tocadero. Try to find, a map that will guide you on how to use the Metro system in France. If you have plan of going to Disneyland, one day isn't enough if you have kids. I hope this is useful enough and enjoy!
Q1099_C17	AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Gay AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  Gay Pareee...   What memories :)
Q1099_C18	Make sure you visit the Make sure you visit the catacombs, which are underground tunnels stuffed with human bombs.  Creepy, but very interesting.   Notre Dame is interesting, but Sacre Couer is my favorite by far.  If you're not really into art then the Lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time.  It's HUGE, and it can take you hours to find the stuff you really want to see.  The Musee D'Orsay is a much smaller gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpieces.  Get to know the Metro system, it is an amazing way to get around.  The Palais Garnier is an underrated attraction.  Hopefully you can visit on a day that is operating tours.  I really enjoy the restaurants in the Marais area, if you're looking for some place to eat.
Q1099_C19	imtinan ..Safe trip to Paris Few more tips, if you still haven't traveled yet.  For Music visit: Palais Garnier.   For Shopping and reasonably priced souvenirs visit: Lafayette and Rue de la Huchette (this oldest street has lots of yummy shawerma)   CuriousButDetermined on the Louvre: "see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt", the same applies to the British Museum, it contains the largest Egyptian antiquities collection, confiscated by the British army back in the days.

Q1099_C21	Paris Favorites: Eating, Paris Favorites: Eating, Drinking and Shoopping.no ,sure not that all limited when the place is Paris.do not by pass visiting Muse de la Mode (10, avenue Pierre Ier de Serbie)The museum is a treasure trove of fashions from the 18th - 20th centuries, it would be a great off the beaten path stop for a trip to Paris and some other tips for you;  Tip #1 for Paris - If you are in Paris driving a car, be aware that people in Paris drive however they want to.   Tip #2 - If you have a car, get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park.   Tip #3 - Learn a bit of French. A great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is Rick Steves' handy pocketbook guide to basic French (find book)   Tip #4 - Use the Metro (the subway). There is simply no better way to get around Paris. But make sure you've brushed up on your French. It will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways.   Tip #5 - The lines and crowds at the Eiffel Tower can get very long.  If you must see the lights of Paris at night (and you should) Go on a week night (not Friday), or make reservations.   TIP #6 - The Louvre. From what I understand, if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums, you could spend weeks there, but for most people, half a day is enough time.  You see the famous pictures (Mona Lisa), and spend some time looking at the amazing art.  if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they're opening, it's free admission.    TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris, it's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe.  If you rent a car and drive here, just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules.     TIP #8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France!  One of them is the Pantheon, which was originally a church, and originally planned to be something other than that .Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there.  Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that's something you want to do.      TIP #9 - Have some small change (or large change if you can afford it) on hand for the street performers. They're pretty good!   TIP #10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches, take some time for Notre' Dame, and if you have a problem with crowds, don't go on the weekend. People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays, but there are a lot of people there on the weekends, so you end up waiting in line, and it gets more noisy inside.   TIP #11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night, get there right before the hour.   TIP #12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free, don't be fooled by talk which says they'll so something for free. IT ISN'T FREE!    __________________________________________ <b>Attitudes are more important than facts...</b>

Q1100	Buying A Personal Car I am planning to purchase my own car and will buy a second hand unit on Cash Basis.  Being an expat how should i go with the process. Do i still need to get a letter from my employer allowing me to purchase my personal Car.  Appreciate much to anyone that could give me some ideas and Feedback.  Thank you
Q1100_C1	RE: Buying A Personal Car If you have driving liciense,you can purchase cars without any letter from your sponsor.To get the liciense you already have got the letter to submit in the driving school,now u r entitled to own a car,go ahead,wish you all the best.
Q1100_C2	RE: Buying A Personal Car U need an NOC from ur sponsor, even if u have a driving licence.
Q1100_C3	RE: Buying A Personal Car 1. Select a car of ur choice. 2. Take it to computer checking. 3. Once u r satisfied with the test, negotiate the price. 4. Go to Muroor with the letter from ur sponsor, Id card, QR250 and the owner of the car, to transfer it to ur name.   Take an ATM or credit card as they don't accept cash. Muroor has typing centre, where u will type the form in arabic, with ur details and cars.
Q1100_C4	RE: Buying A Personal Car We too have a secondhand car..first thing we did was, request an NOC from our sponsor since this was needed when we had the process of car transfer, photocopies of ID's...Just make sure the car you are buying is in very good condition and the insurance or Istimara are valid for another (3-6 mos), 1 year is better.  That way you have ample time to have it check or no more cash are going out of your pocket for repair.  One more thing..check if the car has any traffic violation before the transfer that way the first owner will pay it..on our case we just found out day after that the car has violation on the same day we got the car...too bad for us( we tried to request for photo) to check if it's really our car but the police can't present any proof cause it's a parking violation and it's the mobile police who noted it. We paid it & we don't want to argue anymore..just had it on the wrong time;the violation was made in a place we never visited and the owner of the car already left the country.  Anyway goodluck on your new car.

Q1101_C1	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? Yes, baldrick2dogs is correct.  I asked them the same thing and received the same answer.
Q1101_C2	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? I was been cancelled before then recently came back to Doha.

Same thing with Q-tel, I applied for new connection and still they asked me to pay my outstanding bill which is under my ID number (I did not pay before my arrears since it is just less than 300 QR). Therefore, they will not cancel your account even if your work visa is cancelled.
Q1101_C3	RE: bank account status after leaving doha?? They don't have time to update/ cancel the a/c's of left peoples coz..they are running with short of time to give proper in time service to the existing costomers.

Q1105	used car loan does anybody know processes of used car loan?Banks are paying directly to dealer?if yes,where is the guarantee for seller?is dealer paying to seller after transfering the registeration of car to buyer?i am planing to sell my car but confused about the process
Q1105_C1	RE: used car loan if its a 2nd hand car your talking about, then do NOT go to the banks. Go to financing company, like Jazeera finance or First finance. They have much better rates & the model of the car doesn't matter.
Q1105_C2	RE: used car loan thanks for info i am the seller and i just want to know when i will get my payment,what is payment process?
Q1105_C3	RE: used car loan your car is thru car loan and you want to sell it?  the buyer must pay first, then you go to the bank to pay the car loan amount (full),ask for the clearance from the bank for the full payment of the car loan. (2days) once you have the clearance, you can proceed to traffic dept. for the transfer of ownership (seller and buyer).
Q1105_C4	RE: used car loan If you have a buyer already and he/she wants to pay your car from a bank loan? He should first go to a car dealer,he will get a quotation from them (QR1000 fee), take it to the bank. Bank will give him the money, he then pay you. After receiving the payment you can give him you car.Of course he will do all the transfer of ownership procedure.
Q1105_C5	RE: used car loan thanks for useful info,the buyer wants to buy my car via car loan(Commercial Bank),and the bank asked from buyer to bring the quotation from dealer which we provided already now,that is ok but bank is telling that they will make the payment to Dealer directly and than i will get my money from dealer,is it correct?i dont understand this part in case dealer does not want to pay it to me,where is my guarantee?
Q1106	Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank I took car loan from the bank for 4 years. 3 years are already completed. Can I sell this car without informing the bank, because I am paying with check book every month they are taking my money from my bank. How about the change over process? Thanks for sharing
Q1106_C1	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank Yes, you can sell your car. You have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank. After that process done, the bank will give out NOC to you for you to hand over the NOC to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership. You have to go along with the new buyer to the Insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card. Cheers..
Q1106_C2	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank Dann is correct. You can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second.  But first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding.  If buyer has an account in the same bank, then bullseye! your task is much easier.
Q1106_C3	RE: Can I sell my car still under car loan from the bank If you look at the reverse (back) of your car registration card, at the right hand bottom you will see a column 'Type of Ownership' in Arabic NOUGH ALMUKIA. If you have your banks name written there, you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank.

Q1108	Can I exit with the rp on the old passport? Dear all,  I have just renewed my passport. However, due to the work I was not able to transfer the resident permit on the old passport to the new passport.   Will it be a issue if I want to get the exit permit for a short business trip then come back to Qatar to work?  How long it gonna take if I wanna transfer my resident permit to the new passport?  Thank you  Regards, Lim
Q1108_C1	Your old passport must have Your old passport must have been cancelled when you renew it. Nobody is allowed to travel with cancelled or expired passport.  You can give an allowance of at least one hour to transfer your RP to your new passport. The payment of that transaction is Qatari Riyals 110.
Q1108_C2	You can travel with both You can travel with both passports, just because your old passport is cancelled doen't make your RP cancelled.  I had the same issue last year and just showed my RP in my old passport to immigration, this wasn't a problem...but arrange to have it transferred as soon as you can

Q1108_C7	Working Visa requires an exit Working Visa requires an exit permit to travel outside the country whereas family visa does not require any exit permit.  To apply for an exit permit, a person needs a valid passport, not passports.  I supposed Raven and Oryx are holding family visas.

Q1109	somebody enlighten me pls.. Dear QL's.... i have AOA 150 netbook with windows xp installed when i bought it,i like to try windows 7,i want to know if in case i dont like window 7 can i install window xp back,the original one which i'm supposed to replace? or i can have them both install in my netbook without any problems?help plsss,,, thanks in advance.
Q1109_C1	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. Since Windows 7 is just being released I would say "do not install it yet" and wait some time until you can get some feedback from those already using it.  I know there is a way to have more than one OS in the HD and to have the PC/Laptop ask you with which OS you want to start, but in this case someone with more knowledge should give you a hand on that. I guess it is related to partition the HD and install each OS in each partition available; thus it has to be a High Capacity HD.  Regards!!
Q1109_C2	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. Well normally you get a back up disk which you can use to reinstall your original windows that came with your netbook, but sometimes its kept in a un accessable location on say your second partition. So first confirm that.  To answer your questions YES you can install windows 7 and have Xp if you install them on two separate partitions. You dont want dual operating systems on your netbook then go ahead and just install Win7 you can always downgrade later without any problems, provided you have your Xp cd :)
Q1109_C3	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. appreciate that,,, thanks.
Q1109_C4	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. guys i only have this mini netbook,it doesn't come with cd,so how can i install it back? and how to do the partition you were saying? sorry,dnt know much about lap..thanks again.
Q1109_C5	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. thanks smoke,,,i appreciate that.
Q1109_C6	RE: somebody enlighten me pls.. Better if you just stick with XP as miniPC were designed for if you like to try window 7 then upgrade your PC to higher one sell it and buy new. c,)  cheersss!!!

Q1126	Toyota Prado Car servicing Can anyone recommend a good car service place for my Prado using Toyota spare parts? I have just imported my 1 year old Prado from Dubai and local Toyota garage want QAR 5000 just to register it on their system - robbery with the lights on I say!!! Any suggestions gratefully received. Regards Tony
Q1126_C1	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing all the major car companies chrage the same here unless you have GCC coverage
Q1126_C2	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing I imported prado from Dubai an year ago and Toyota dealer asked the same. I am taking the vehicle to Tayseer service station and they are excellent. You can actually monitor what technician is doing. Make sure that he follows the maintenance schedule.   Even if you flush the engine, change japan make oil filter and use mobile 10,000 Km oil it will not cost more than 300 QR where as in Toyota, the same with 5000 Km oil will cost around QR 800  1000. Go to salwa road Tayseer and get the vehicle serviced in less than 2 hrs. In Toyota dealer it will take not less than one entire day.
Q1126_C3	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing Just noticed you said your car is one year old.  For sure it is under warranty so check with Toyota Dubai to see if your warranty is valid at any Toyota dealer which it should be. It is possible that the story I relayed to you was in fact I believe either Toyota or BMW. If your warranty is valid I would definitely go to the proper authorities at the ministry of economy and commerce and report the Toyota dealer. MAke them service your vehicle under the conditions of the warranty you agreed to . Believe me they know what they are doing and they know it is wrong but yet they still try to bend the conditions to their liking . Make them honor the rules they have the responsibility to uphold.  I am sure for every car they have to service from outside Qatar there is one that leaves they dont have to.
Q1126_C4	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing In addition to complaining to the Ministry, send a complaint to Toyota-Japan; I'm sure they don't accept such crooked practices; and if they do, never buy a Toyota again.
Q1126_C5	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing Other than American cars none of the other cars are provided GGC-Wide warranty. Check your documents. If you dont have GCC wide warranty then there is nothing much even the Ministry can do and Neither will Toyota HQ do anything about it.
Q1126_C6	RE: Toyota Prado Car servicing Teyseer may be OK for routine Oil change ,filter etc  - but In know Toyota  has a  service checklist for a certain Odometer reading .

Q1145_C3	Oil and gas companies <a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/oi56k2.jpg" border="0" alt="/"> . .  <b>Oil and gas companies pay higher than average and they dont usually distinguish between nationalities. However, the private sector does depend on nationality.  To give you some idea of the possible range for an engineer let me cite an example.  Civil engineer indian national working in private sector on a permenant type contract.... expect a salary not exceeding 6000-10000 QAR all inclusive.  Civil engineer european national working on oil and gas project, fixed term contract (3-4 years)..... expect $500-$700 per day.  So you can see there are alot of factors which contribute:eg... type of organisation, type of contract, your nationality, years of experience, any middle east experience etc etc.</b> . .  <a href="http://tinypic.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/29658m.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and vid

Q1153_C2	As far as i know, You need to As far as i know, You need to get a NOC letter from your employer, which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary, and the nationality of the maid you want to get. Take this to the labour department on C-ring road (i guess), there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC. Will take atleast a week for the approval to come. Once you get the approval, give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids, and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa, flights, etc.

Q1156	Dog grooming We are looking at moving to Qatar, we have a cockapoo who needs regular clipping, is it easy to find dog groomers.  Are dogs allowed on the beaches and are there many places to walk dogs in Doha? Thanks Anxious DOg Owner
Q1156_C1	Yes there are dog groomers there are 2 vets that offer the service.  Doha Vets and Qatar Vet Centre  Dog walking places are minimil. If you are going to be staying in a compound, you would be able to walk around there.   Cornish is another option, but you get hassled by locals who will tell you that its not allowed, but there are no signs, so I generally ignore them and tell them that my dogs are not bothering them, and until there are signs I will keep walking my dogs there.  The best place is from the Emiri Diwan side towards the new Islamic museum.  Never in the direction of Sheraton, as there are many more people.  There are a few beaches, but on weekends too many crowds.  Walking through the streets you will be hassled by people driving by, barking at you, or asking how much you will sell your dog for, or generally just harrassing if you are a woman.  Hope this helps.  <p> &quot;if you don't like the heat... get out of the kitchen... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave... it will burn you on the a** as you go through the doorway....&quot; ME  </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>visit www.qaws.org

Q1159_C2	Virgin - Landmark I saw a beautiful Alienware laptop in the Virgin store at Landmark last Saturday - I have no idea of the price, I just know I can't afford it!
Q1159_C3	You mean vilagio's Virgin Do you know which alienware it was? 11, 15 or 17 inches ?
Q1159_C4	get urs from USA get it custom made and at half the price ! Go for it !
Q1159_C5	Wish i could! Well i really wanna go for it, but (you might not be aware of this) since late january Intel has recalled all its new Sandy Bridge chipsets which the new Alienware M17x-R3 is equiped with, so production of this model has been stopped ever since, and it's due to be resumed early march hopefully, so until then my hands are tied!
Q1159_C6	alienware you will find it in virgin megastore there lot alienware models there. prices are i guess 13000,26000,6000 +
Q1159_C7	Don't buy it locally, either Don't buy it locally, either go to Dubai and get one there or buy it online and ship it through Aramex. All the Alienwares you'll find here will be outdated or super expensive. But even if you buy it online, for good specs you're looking at 2000-$2500 excluding Aramex fees. Buy an MSI instead, they're fairly cheap and look cool. Or if you're willing to buy online check Sager. I bought one recently and it's been working like a charm.
Q1159_C8	I saw one alienware laptop at I saw one alienware laptop at virgin megastore in villagio. You may look for some dell resellers.
Q1159_C9	very rarely seen in Qatar. very rarely seen in Qatar.
Q1159_C10	saw alot of alienware in Dubai last week ! saw alot of alienware in Dubai last week !
Q1159_C11	Qatar doesnt have any specific store suggest you build your own specs and order directly from the US. even if you find any Alienware in Qatar the specs would be limited. I have some friends who directly ordered from the US as they did not like the specs available here. It was mere basic and super expensive as always.  Best of Luck.
Q1159_C12	Actually that's what I had in Actually that's what I had in mind, but my concern was does Dell ship to Qatar ? How exactly did your friends receive their laptops?
Q1159_C13	I have been looking for an HP I have been looking for an HP i7, DV6 3175 past two months, this great country doesnt have them. You get it in any kiosk in Dubai. Gr8 Qatar
Q1159_C14	Let's say my customization Let's say my customization adds up to 3000$, if customs are at 5% then that would make 150$, so why 700$ ? And can't I order directly from Dell?
Q1159_C15	pro gamer I think you are confused, any items imported to Qatar more than 700 USD has around 5% tax.  But obviously before shipping you better call Aramex or DHL and confirm them the actual invoice amount so they can confirm to you.  Regarding Dell, i am not sure but on Amazon and Bestbuy you have tons of Alien ware on sale.
Q1159_C16	Oh ok got it, I mis Oh ok got it, I misunderstood you the first time, I thought that I have to pay 700$ of taxes. Thank you very much for your help I really appreciate it. One last question, do you have any idea how much to expect for the shipping ?

Have you tried H&M? They did have many trousers, price range was 160-250Qar. The other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched.
Q1163_C3	Haven't tried Mothercare at Haven't tried Mothercare at CC.  I hate going there but I may have to...  M&S does not have a Maternity section.  I don't get this... every local has at least 5 kids, plus every expat seems to be pregnant.  Where do they all shop for clothes?
Q1163_C4	Mothercare is likely to have Mothercare is likely to have but again prices are just too much. I think it would just be better of you have them shipped in. Have you also tried Babyhope? I think they have a maternity section too.....H&M is also a good try.
Q1163_C5	M and their I tried H&M and their selection was ok.  The only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down.  Just too hip and cool for me.  I'm old and I need mom jeans!  :-)  I will try BHS.     I'm used to Target and discount stores.  The idea of paying $80-$100 for a pair of pants that I will wear for 6 months is impossible.  Checked online, shipping from Motherhood Maternity from the States is $70 for a ton of clothes.  I think I will just do that....   Thanks ladies!   (and thank you men for holding in your  impossibly crude comments that you all love to make on every thread!)
Q1163_C6	babyshop and Max try babyshop and Max in City Center. thay have good collection
Q1163_C7	hi Minoush, you will have to hi Minoush, you will have to go to Mothercare at CC, because apparently all maternity wear from other MC shops are to shift to MC of CC, if not already there.  You need to visit the MC inside Debenhams.  The locals wear the abbaya, so a loose gown inside ( the jalabiyas, more like the house maxis) is not visible to anybody. Among Asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now, with lycra tights, so again no problems there.  Getting T's is not an issue, as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day. The trouser style, is the low bump style right now, and it doesnt really fall off.H&M had the high waist trousers.  not sure about baby shop for Maternity clothes, else you may have to try the large clothes section, like Evans, if you are looking for comfy tops.  Check Giordano as well, they dont have maternity, but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump.

Q1166_C1	RE:  I have faild 4 times my driving test from Karwa. Can... My dear, I suggest you not to worry. I also took full driving course from Karwa driving school. While taking the course instructor told me that I may pass in my first attempt. But unfortunately I failed 3 times. I passed only on my 4th attempt. I accept that Karwa driving school is good for learning driving but during test because of several people there will be little bit tension. Regarding your question, Again you have to join either 7day(1 chance will be given for test) or 15day(2 to 3 chances will be given for test) course to reapper the test. Dont worry you will pass when your time comes. Before, I also more worried about driving license. Finally I am driving on roads very safely.  Best of luck, Rama

Q1167_C22	Yikes Habib! I hope that is a joke.... Having known women involved in polygyny I found it really sad to see the toll it took on their self-esteem and the way their husbands played one off against the other to gain "top spot". I realize that not all polygynous marriages are like that, but all I have known are.   Also, outside of religion I have to agree with Gypsy. If it is supposed to be so easy for a woman to accept her mate sleeping with someone else, then men should be able to handle it too. The fact that you know you cannot, shows you know it also presents a serious hardship on women -- even if it is "allowable" according to religion or law.   <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em> </p>
Q1167_C23	That's not true keiko before you post about something being allowable in Islam you should really do your research carefully, rather than just take one person's word for it.

Q1167_C25	see sura 4:3 and article More thoughts on polygamy: .......... Koran or Quran Noble Verse : Sura  4:3 http://www.submission.org/suras/sura4.htm ........... http://www.answering-christianity.com/polygamy.htm
Q1167_C26	Keiko, I am sure all of us Muslims know this surah and what we know is that based on the Quran and hadith a Muslim man is allowed to have up to 4 wives providing he can support them equally and divides his time equally. A Muslim woman has the right to choose not to be in a polygynous marriage and she can divorce a husband who chooses this against her wishes.   Muslims feel that polygyny is a right granted by Allah and although it may not be advisable to exercise every right, a man who is hell-bent on having more than one wife will do so, using his religious right to do so.   I'm not really sure what you are trying to add here or getting at with these links but believe me, this has been discussed endlessly and I seriously doubt anybody will change their minds. If you are interested in Islam I would suggest you find a good imam near you to talk to. Many of the internet sites can lead you down the wrong path (submission.org being one of them).   <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em> </p>
Q1167_C27	I was a teenager in the US but maybe it is different for girls because I did not see sex as a sport and did not like the notion of competing with another woman when my heart was involved.  I really can't relate to what you are saying here. Perhaps the painful reality of so many polygynous marriages hits too close to home to me.   In fact, I would think that Islamic polygyny when practiced properly (if there is such a thing) is not supposed to make the women feel in competition with each other. I always thought it places a tremendous burden on men to make sure they are not hurting their wife/wives and make each feel special in her own right -- not compared to the competition. I don't think most men are able to fulfill that role and I expect to see a lot of "paralyzed" men on the Day of Judgment. Moreover, I think it shows a lack of faith that so many take the matter so lightly. It seems to me they are living for earthly pleasure with no concern about accountability.   <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em> </p>
Q1167_C28	PM, I was not intending that as a good reason for polygamy, But only using it as a perspective through which to view American culture. No.  It is cruel for a man to make such a competition between his wives.  The same cruelty happens between unmarried people through dating, flirting, etc.  It also occurs when someone is flaunting wealth. Whatever intentionally provokes negative feelings that harm a person's contentment and inner peace is a sort of cruelty.  This is the reason for the hijab, and also for the prohibition (only for men) of wearing gold or silk.   Part of what I wanted to make noticed is how much of contemporary western consumer society is centered around the drive to provoke such feelings - lust, envy, jealousy, etc. in others about one's self.  The "if you got it, flaunt it" mentality. That people in the west are now so addicted to this game, is the reason why they react in such horror at the idea of hijab, especially, as if it nullifies any reason for a woman to live if she does not strut her stuff. So I was only trying to see polygamy through the competition lens to make a point about this cultural trend.
Q1167_C29	You may be right Habib but in the 10 years I have been in Qatar I have witnessed jealousy, envy, greed and materialism on a scale I never knew existed in the West. It really was a shock to my system and while I might have found it curious in the beginning, I now see it as so un-Godly it's hard to even believe you are in the heart of Islam. Maybe you haven't been here that long. It would be interesting to see how you feel after 10 years.   <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong>I refuse to drink the kool-aid!</strong> -- <em>PM</em> </p>
Q1167_C30	Well, Qatar is a VERY small place, and unique in being THE wealthiest nation in the world. It would not be scientific, to say the least, to take observations of Qatar, and use that as a measuring stick to judge all of Arabs and Muslims, much less Islam.  First, as a Muslim you know yourself that there is a wide gap between the ideal of Islam, and the current state of Muslims.  And to spend too much breath defending ourselves as we actually are would be a waste except when it is in defense of truth and fairness.  I have enough real faults as it is to put up with kafrs making things up.  Secondly, yes. If perhaps I think about the small town I grew up in Missouri to the wealth of Doha, then there is certainly a lot more materialism and greed here.  But if I were to compare Doha to an equally wealthy place in the U.S. then it would be hard to believe that there is that much more greed here.  What there is more of here, but less than in most of the Arab world, I think, is monopolization, the sort of nepotism which kills efficiency, an unfortunate emphasis on irrelevant forms of status (e.g. family and tribal membership) over quality work and capability, and extremem disparity.  None of these are healthy in Islamic standards.  Remember the Prophet warned not to be destroyed by what destroyed those who came before - which was that they were strict in punishing the poor but leniant in letting the rich get away with things.  He warned but the Arabs after some time did not listen.  So, it did certainly harm them, and is destroying them, at least socially.   Still, they are my brothers and I am with them in the same boat...whether they all acknowledge that or not.

Q1175	Another thing Learnt. QUESTION: Why is there salt in the ocean?
Q1175_C1	To safeguard water in To safeguard water in it....we humans would have depleted its water by drinking otherwise....
Q1175_C2	there are so many WHY there are so many WHY questions including this one :)
Q1175_C3	It is estimated that the It is estimated that the oceans formed about 500 million years ago. A lot of the salt entered the oceans during their formative years. As igneous rocks cooled below the oceans, they released a lot of the salt into the oceans. More salt entered the oceans as rock and sediments on the ocean floor dissolved. Still more salt entered the ocean through the erosion of the land. As mountains gradually break down and rains wash over the land, naturally occurring salts of the Earth are washed into the ocean. As water from the ocean evaporates, the salts are left behind, so the ocean gets more salty with time.   http://www.strangequestions.com/question/709/Why-is-there-salt-in-the-ocean.html
Q1175_C4	I thought... Because all the sealife creatures do susu in it that's why it is salty...

Q1194	HMC Promotions and Recruitment Does anyone know when does the promotions and recruitment start in HMC? Is it true that there is no money to give the employees promotion ? Is it true that many staff thinks HMC is becoming a less desirable place to work ?
Q1194_C1	Scorpio78 your tag line "Give the worker his dues, his rights, before his sweat dries" by the Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) should be pasted in all the management offices at HMC.   Any sector in HMC which would be left behind would somehow impact on the overall performance. I hope this will be ironed out soon for the benefit of all concerned. =) __________________________________________________ "No one is in charge of your happiness except you"
Q1194_C2	I absolutely refuse to I absolutely refuse to believe that this is done because of economical crisis. It is all because of the inexperienced and inefficient administration of HMC. Everyday there is some news of buying ultra expensive technology and equipments for HMC, however, they don't have money to pay their staff.     Also, they are constantly pressurising staff to perform better than their best. Well,all of us know the old saying. Pay peanuts and get monkeys to work. HMC will soon turn into a monkey show.      And no, nothing is going to change in March 2010. If there was a real problem, it could be solved. There is no end to fake problems.         Are you nuts?......no doubt I am crazy about you!
Q1194_C3	Is it true? Is it true that all promotions for expatriates are stopped for next 2 years as part of cost-cutting by the hospital? A friend of mine said that , thats the reason why they are giving 1  month bonus to deviate the people's attention from the worst thats yet to come!
Q1194_C4	never heard of that issue never heard of that issue medboy but hopefully not.as far as i know they keep on recruiting nurses and i dont know with other sectors in the hospital.lets wait for 2010 coz they still working this out and inshallah we will get the increment.its hard to hope and expect that far.lets just cross our fingers...

Q1196	Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take it to India I am constructing a House in India. Wondering whether I can buy house hold items like LCD,Split ACs,cooking range, furniture etc from Qatar and take it to India. If yes what are the suggested items to purchase here. Also any reliable Sea Cargo -door to door service available  Thanks in advance
Q1196_C1	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... A big no...U just waste money on shipping...And u get very good ones in India.
Q1196_C2	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... NOOOOOOOO.  only few items I found in Qatar which has good quality and cheap price compared to India are :- 1. Saffron 2. Gold (Price is almost same But quality is good )
Q1196_C3	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... Dude, it is not good idea to buy house hold items from here, since all the branded stuffs easily available in India with better price & warranty.
Q1196_C4	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... I did that mistake six years ago. Dealing with clearing agents at customs, and labourer union at customs yard was a nightmare I will never forget.They suck your blood to the last drop.
Q1196_C5	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... Not at all recommended - you get every households at your doorsteps.  You could carry some of the best chocolates etc. instead...which will be cheaper than duty free shops there.
Q1196_C6	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... Electronic items are subject to guarantee or warranty. What will you do if something goes wrong with the LCD TV, Slit AC, Washing Machine and Cooking Range? If your are buying them from India most of them are with 2-5 years warranty and some are with 1-2 years guarantee. Some brands are offering extended warranty by paying some extra money. If something goes wrong you can call the shop where you bought it and they will arrange with the Service Centre for the necessary action. I know that some products have International Warranty but it is not as easy as you are buying something locally in India. Further more you will have to spend a lot of money for cargo even if it is by sea.
Q1196_C7	RE: Is it worth buying Household Items in Qatar and take... Good Qaulity branded materials will get in India..these are made in China...

Q1203_C14	That way people drink cold water after eating meals... That way people drink cold water after eating meals... they dont die... its just abuse of the system...ts over the years that it affects the body's metabolism...  ...like if you dont sleep for 24 hrs you wont die ...and many people skip sleep ... it affects them later on.  Ayurveda treat the cause not the symptoms...Modern Medicine treats the symptom  eg: If you are having a headache.. Modern Medicine practitioners would give you a tablet to stop the ache... painkiller...  While Ayurveda Practitioners reach into your body to find the cause...all in a minute!  Jews I guess too avoid Milk with Meat.  its not complete nonsense... as Ayurveda used for treatment of a lot of disease... and Ayurveda Doctors scan your body in a minute (unlike time taking tests modern medicine) by holding your pulse at 3 points.  Snessy the info given to you was half true... food is related to digestion... nothing to do with patches ..maybe just to scare children...lol  a well trained stomach can even overcome very high levels of poison...like Rasputin did ... its also mentioned in the Indian History of Chanakya who used to train himself and his King to overcome poison by taking very tiny levels of poison... and increasing its dosage accordingly  Ayurveda considers the stomach as the route of all diseases...

Q1203_C23	i heard abt drinking milk i heard abt drinking milk after eating fish is dangerous..can drink milk after 2 hours after eating fish not before that.  bt about prawns no danger at all
Q1203_C24	Ayurveda has guidelines about food... Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like:  # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat, fish, yoghurt, cheese, buttermilk and fromage frais.  # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water, or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit.  # Avoid reheated or stale food.  # Most of one's food should be cooked, as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad).  # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty, but support the digestive processes as well.  # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology.  # During meals you may sip liquids such as water, juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes.  # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast, cereals etc). Minimise food of other tastes.  # Honey should not be heated above body temperature (40 degrees C) and therefore should not be used in cooking or baking.  There is also an exhaustive list on the combination of food which is good and bad.
Q1203_C25	I only know yoghurt and fish I only know yoghurt and fish should not be eaten together.
Q1203_C26	More... Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together, it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items.   Don't eat grain, cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits, grapes, pineapple etc.  Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy, carbohydrate rich food items.  Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal, independent of other regular meals.  Milk and meat is bad combination.  Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together, it becomes toxic.   Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule.  Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable.  Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayurveda.   One needs to end a full-belly meal with some hot and light item like buttermilk. Buttermilk is curd diluted with water and added with a pinch of salt, chilly powder, some curry leaves and a bit of ginger. Many times ginger and curry leaves are avoided from the combination, only due to difficulty in availability.  Other factor to keep in mind with Ayurvedic food combination includes the endurance of the digestive system. A strong digestive fire (pitta) almost over-rides some of the effects associated with unscientific food combination. Not all are blessed with such a strong digestive fire.  And the most important food rule by Ayurveda Don't burden your digestive system by eating too full. Over-eating is already a strict no-no, Ayurveda suggests you take half-stomach solid food, fill a quarter with water and leave the rest free. This is best for proper digestion.

Q1211	Sponsoring Friend to Doha Hi QL,  My friend in Abudabi want to visit me in Doha. How do I sponsor visa for them. Any prior experices please share.
Q1211_C1	RE: Sponsoring Friend to Doha hey buddy had to do this myself a month back and here's what i learned:  1)first up, you can normally only sponsor your immediate family or blood relatives on a visit to qatar. what that means is you cant sponsor your friend since he is not related to you. i have heard of some people with special work visas who are able to do so but im guessing you aren't one of them  2)now the only option you have is to get a visa through a hotel for your friend..within this option you have two more options; you can get a one month tourist visa for a thousand rials but he will have to stay in the hotel which will be expensive..your second and more feasible option is a business visa through the hotel..this will however cost you 2000 rials, be valid for three months but the friend can stay with you instead of the hotel..there's a few hotels that do this and you could try gulf horizon behind standard chartered bank near the souq waqif/souq asiri area near the corniche.  3)now depending on the budget; if your friend is visiting for long, then the business visa will be expensive but save the expense and hassle of staying in the hotel. but if it's a short visit then you could inquire about the hotel's rates for his stay..  so yeah; i managed to get my buddy into doha because he was ready to pay 2000 for a business visa..hope you and your buddy can get together and have a great time too..best of luck buddy:-)

I hope others can help you with what might be popular there. Keep in mind, though, no pork products in Qatar. All those dim sums will have to be seafood or vegetarian.

Just step in to cooperative store or big hyper market, nowadays 100s of advertisements are there looking for people to share it, or rent independantely the apartment for reasonable rate. So you try to keep moving into the cooperative store from location to location so most of the advertisements are found stick on their wall, with contact nos. and you can manage to get one without any difficulty approx. not morethan 4000/- a best one.

Q1221	Conditions for getting a NOC Hello all. I am currently interviewing for a nanny. We found someone who we would like to employ, BUT she said that her current employer will only give her a NOC (no objection certificate) if she or I pay them 6000 Riyals??? She has worked for them for 4 years. Can I still employ her without the NOC?. I don't think its fair that they are asking for 6000 QAR......Any help/advise will be greatly appreciated. Thanks
Q1221_C1	why wouldn't you contact the why wouldn't you contact the sponsor and talk to him/her? Are you sure that the sponsor demans the money?
Q1221_C2	Spoke to the Sponsor I called and spoke to the sponsor. They paid 7000QAR for her 4 years ago. They want that money back!
Q1221_C3	I put my adverts on every I put my adverts on every grocery store also here in Qatar Living and check adverts everywhere such as newspapers, grocery advertisement board and also here in QL! I never approach any agency as my friends used to get their maids from agencies and end up with lots of expenses but if there's anything goes wrong with the maids they are obligued to replaced them but it will be additional expenses for you. The easiest way for you to do is apply for a maid visa depending on the nationalities you prepared and when visa is approved, then you can start searcing for the right candidate locally who are looking for an employer who can give them visa. Otherwise, there are also free-lancers, who do not need sponsorship but of course you have to give them weekend day off as they are not under your sponsorship, you are less in control of the situation. I had phobia sponsoring maids as they tend to jump off the ship and get into trouble with CID. so in the end I just hire free-lancers! it may not be cheaper but less headache!  ;)
Q1221_C4	7000 should be amortized over 7000 should be amortized over 4 years..:) To be honest, don't know what to suggest..  I wouldnt go the way jjh is suggesting.... puting the ads in the grocery stores to get a nanny for your kids isn't the best way to hire a good companion for them.. 6000 is a high price.. on the other hand if you go through the agency, it won't be much cheaper.. You just have to come to conclusion that having a nanny isn't cheap.. and pay the fee...
Q1221_C5	jjh, there is no such thing jjh, there is no such thing in qatar like free-lancer. you are violating the law and encourage other people (your "free-lancers") to violate the law... That's what must bring you a headache, not sponsoring them..
Q1221_C6	your experience is illegal. your experience is illegal. You cannot employ someone who is not under your sponsorship without a legal permission from the authorities.
Q1221_C7	are you a sri lankan??? i are you a sri lankan??? i have visa for sri lankan.. try to get a filipino visa then lets exchange.. give me a call 33237997..
Q1221_C8	How will that help? Hi. I am South African......How will this exchange work? The person I want to employ will still need the NOC, ?? I want to avoid paying such a vast sum of money.... Please explain!
Q1221_C9	NOC should not cost you! There are lots of maid looking for a job don't stick to the one you know! most sponsor are opportunist! if they see an opportunity they will demand, although they want to get rid of their maid they want to make money in the last minute! I release my maids at no cost! especially those who are troublesome!  Worse comes to worst you will pay for that amount and the maid is a troublesome! so how can you get your expenses back? If they are good worker the employer  will keep them and will not try to make money in order to release them! they only demand because they think they have waste a lot of money employing her!
Q1221_C10	employed for 4 years! She has been employed with her current sponsor for 4 years and the previous sponsor for 5 years all here in Doha and was in Kuwait before that. I definitely do not think that her current sponsor wasted their money... She spent an hour with us and played with my son. We were very happy with the way she spoke and conducted herself. If she does not get her NOC then will she have to leave the country?? Is there any way in which I can avoid paying the 6000 QAR?  Thanks

Q1230_C1	I hope it answers your query Flying With Your Pet FAQAir travel for animals can be tricky and dangerous business, so it is important to know what the law, the airlines, and veterinarians recommend. QuestionsHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet? What steps should I take prior to a flight to make sure my pet's trip goes smoothly and safely?  Can my pet travel in the cabin of the airplane, rather than in the cargo hold?  What does the law require me to do if my pet is going to travel in the plane's cargo hold?  AnswerHow do I know if air travel is appropriate for my pet?Not all pets can or should travel by plane. Air travel is stressful for pets, so you should consider a number of factors before deciding to transport your pet on an airplane, including your pet's disposition, age, breed and health.  Heat or Pregnancy. Animals who are in heat or who are pregnant should not travel by plane.  Age. Federal law requires that animals be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned (meaning weaned for at least five days) before they travel in the cargo hold of a plane. Although the law does not say so, veterinarians generally recommend against putting elderly pets through the discomfort of air travel.  Breed. Pug-nosed animals should never travel in the cargo hold of a plane. This is because of the structure of their faces, which may inhibit their breathing during air travel. If your dog is of one of the breeds listed below, be sure to discuss the issue with your veterinarian and with the airline. Many airlines will not accept pug-nosed animals for air travel. The following dogs are considered to be pug-nosed:  American StaffordshireEnglish Toy SpanielDutch PugShih TzuStaffordshire Bull TerrierBrussels GriffinPekineseBoston TerrierEnglish BulldogJapanese Pug, andJapanese Spaniel.

He is a fantastic coach, one of the best ive worked with. Genuine Muay Thai passion with great teaching. I never let anyone cover my boxing classes except Inigo because he knows boxing very well also.  If you want to learn genuine Muay Thai then I would highly recommend him. Also for boxing, swimming and tennis. The guy is a legend!

Me presently working in a logistics company earning 30,000 INR.
Q1234_C1	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... For 7000k you can't survive here. Think before making further move. Good luck!
Q1234_C2	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... this offer kind of OK if they provide u Family Accomodation.
Q1234_C3	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... You will spent minimum 3500Qr for your accomodation(partitioned villa 1BHK...managable space!!!), for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month. then your childrens studies etc etc... if your company will give you family accomodation, transport its ok.. you can think about it!!
Q1234_C4	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... That's hard ,For having 2 kids,u need accomodation not less than 3500 Qr/month other than the cost of living,may be that can be accpetable if ur wife found a job this is applicable but not guarnteed
Q1234_C5	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... now v r here in qatar in the same condition with 2 kids and same salary,,but no savings,,so please c for any other good chances,,besst of luck,,,
Q1234_C6	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... sharing accomodation : 3000 - 3500 QR Grocery : 1000 - 1500 QR school fees : 1250 - 1750 QR conveyance : 1250 - 1500 QR  From the above figures you can decide whether it is worth taking the offer.
Q1234_C7	RE: I got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation... No way... The offer is not good for supporting a family... One fully furnished 1BHK flat will go not below QAR 5000/-... This offer could be still considerable if the company provides you with a family accomodation +QR 7000. Thats the most expensive thing here... Negotiate with the company or else wait for better opportunity...

Q1237	if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni can we get married if i come to qatar on a tourist visa? can i live in qatar with him after we marry? Instead of me staying in a hotel am i alowwed to stay at his flat if he stays in a hotel until we make the marriage contract? What will we need to do?
Q1237_C1	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... Legally speaking you are not allowed to live together without being married and if caught can be deported. And you cannot get married without a Resident Visa in Doha. So better get married outside first, get a visa and come to Doha. Once married you CAN live together. No problem.
Q1237_C2	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... Emily - i just checked with my colleague here and here is what he had to say.  He said you cannot marry in Qatar without a letter from your father giving you permission to marry and it should be attested in the US. Also you need to have 3 of your OWN witnesses.
Q1237_C3	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... It's cheaper to marry in Las Vegas!
Q1237_C4	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... You both need a residency permit to be married in Qatar. You will not get one since you are not employed and cannot be sponsored by a fianc. You will have to be married elsewhere - if indeed, that is wise.
Q1237_C5	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... Hi Emily,   Are you in Yemen now? Is it because of the hassle of getting married to a foreigner?  I am British and married a Yemeni woman. It was a real headache to get the paperwork done and took a lot of time.   I considered leaving Yemen and getting married abroad, too, but it really is not possible. An American I knew in Yemen took his wife (to be) to Egypt to get married, but once he got back to Yemen, I heard that the authorities did not deem the marriage legal and he had to go through the whole process. (This is what I heard, but I cannot be 100% sure.)  I am not sure of your situation, but can totally sympathise with you, as the whole process took me two years to complete. I had my UK paperwork done in 3 months, it was the Yemeni side which took forever!  I don't think it is possible for you to get married outside of Yemen unless you take your fiancee to the States, where you should be able to get it done.   But then again, visas to the US for Yemenis are not so easy to come by.   Wish you luck.  AQ
Q1237_C6	RE: if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni... You can try the American Embassy in Qatar and do the registration certificate which should be ok and official, check the US Embassy in Doha.

Q1238_C5	RE: Where i hve to apply for vote next indian election Dear Trad. Cont.  I feel sorry and shame on you, as an Indian do you know what is democracy and value of right to vote..... Democracy has become even more important in the present scenario.Democracy is said to be the rule of majority and majority should have the authority otherwise there would be serious consequences. When the basic rights of people are denied then they become livid and don't give respect to the rights of others. That's why violence is on rise. In democracy people decide who will govern and who will rule. If the democracy is established in its true form and the institutions are strengthened so that every one is accountable for what he had done, the world will be a better place for living.  In democracy access to justice is equal for every one and no one can snub the rights of others. Rule of law is insured and hence people respect each other's rights.In today's world terrorism and extremism are on rise. Suicide attacks have threatened everyone and the basic reason is injustice. When innocent people are denied of their rights they do not remain innocent any more. When people are not given respect then they don't care for the respect of others. This is the point where democracy becomes important as it protects the rights of the people, and in order to establish democracy you should have voting rights.  Come on wake up Trad.cont. you are in 2011, don't be a fool of your self.......

Q1245	What Defines Beauty? What are the physical traits which contribute to on being beautiful? What are the key parameters? I wonder how some people look so beautiful/handsome and some don't!
Q1245_C1	I don't agree with all these I don't agree with all these sorry poknat. ugly women say the beauty is internal ! bullshit there is beautiful and ugly! (I'm mathematician)  ugly women should accept it that's all and avoid over makeup because that will make here look uglier.
Q1245_C2	how do you define ugliness or how do you define ugliness or beauty?
Q1245_C3	PHYSICAL traits? - symetry is a sine qua non quality to be beautifull/harmonious. - color (white teeth, red lips, eyes, one-color hair...) - cleanliness (hair well done, skin, teeth...) - smell - sound (voice) - size/ratios (chest-waist-hips) - forms (long neck, face shape, hair, dress..)
Q1245_C4	BEAuty....^^ The standard of beauty is not definite, you define it.  It is how you carry yourself in the face of all the people, situation surrounding you. For you, how do you define beauty? Everyone here has a word to say about beauty and if that is there personal view about the topic than so be it....^^
Q1245_C5	Beauty is as unique as every individuals imaginative mind! Beauty is a very big word that most people do not understand and easily mis-interprete most times.   Have you ever wondered why some find tall ladies pretty and others think petite ladies make the world go round? and why do some like light skin tone and others will go anywhere around the world just to have a darker skin tone?? or why do some people simply just get bored of the beauty queen the married recently?   its because, BEAUTY IS A COMBINATION OF DESIRABLE  PHYSICAL, MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES.  PHYSICAL beauty is a combination of qualities like shape of body, color (light or dark tone of skin, hair, eyes not necesarily ethnic background) and form so that it causes a pleasing effect on the beholders senses. The right mix of this differs from person to person. Its better known as pretty in females and handsome in males or good looking in general.  MORAL beauty is influenced by culture and traditions(also religion) of the locality. and moral beauty qualities includes modesty, comportment, respect, charisma, cleanliness and others. INTELLECTUAL beauty is wisdom or practical use of knowledge.  We can see that, Though it is not wrong, most people judge beauty based on the physical only, but this is just a part of beauty called "looks" and is only skin- deep, not the total beauty. A true and total beauty is a person that has a reasonable amount of the physical, moral and intellectual beauty. This is the standard used for most beauty pageants, but offcourse, the moral and intellectual part is usually played low. Your Grandma can be a moral and intellectual beauty but not a looker!...atleast not anymore. ;).  What might be beautiful to one is not to the other since everyone has a different standard of measure, but can agree on a general level.  On a final note, since physical beauty can tarnish with time, timelesss beauty can be said to be the inner moral and intellectual beauty of any person.   Everyone can be beautiful,... without surgery.  Think about it.

Q1245_C9	"Women are not ugly:  the "Women are not ugly:  the drinks are not  enough!" (Romanian saying..)
Q1245_C10	beauty is in the eyes of beauty is in the eyes of "looker" not in the "looked". But we may agree that at a certain level there's a basis on which all humans agree. it's all about proportions. if you take the composition of a human face. each element alone is ugly. and as placed together they may be good looking or ugly. and because we always look to human faces our brain can rapidly differentiate very small details and amplify these in the scale of beauty.  look at black people of African tribes (no offenses) they may be regarded by a blonde as all ugly. but in fact they developed a differentiating criteria and new scale of beauty.  let's look at you cat. cats see human faces the same. because we also see cats all the same.

Q1245_C11	Buty is Modesty... When you look someone male or female you should feel the kindness and peace.  A man is modest when he admire his wife always and keeping himself away from other women and a Wife is modest when she show her beauty only to her husband and men and women both are modest when they find the happiness through making her husband or his Wife happy.  Making a life as the wish of GOD make them modest.  As a Muslim I am so proud to say that I see my Wife as the most beautiful girl in the world. That makes me to stay away from all other women.

Q1250	Traffic News on the Radio? Why aren't traffic reports broadcast regularly on the local QBS radio during the rush hours?

Q1250_C3	My favourite english radio My favourite english radio stations in Qatar:  1. Studio one FM (KSA) 2. Radio 2 (UAE) 3. Radio Bahrain  Ditto!
Q1250_C4	Frequencies added to Mike's post My favourite english radio stations in Qatar:  1. Studio one FM (KSA)  91.4 or 94.1 (can't remember which?) 2. Radio 2 (UAE) 106.0 3. Radio Bahrain  96.5   These are for the English language stations which you can receive here  All a bit 'weather-dependent'- unfortunately - but somewhat miraculous that they work at all.  Also if all else fails try 101.7 for the sound feed from Al Jazeera English TV news channel. Makes any prog with sub-titles a bit tricky though. :-)

Q1250_C6	There was a day when they There was a day when they were playing some ass-boring music and then this british guy, with a strange voice (Bernie) said he got tired of getting SMS criticizing his musical choices, and that he did not care and therefore he would continue playing the same ole-same ole.  That was the day when I stopped listening to this GRAP!
Q1250_C7	Channel 4 from Dubai On 104.8 MHz is also sometimes receivable. But all the long distance FM channels seem to have gone in the last few days with the arrival of Autumn? Must be a heat/humidity thing that allows us to receive them in Summer.
Q1250_C8	I thought Bernie is Irish? that's what was said on that radio station when one of the announcer (forgot his name) negated that him and Bernie sounded alike.
Q1250_C9	If Dubai and Bahrain FM radio If Dubai and Bahrain FM radio stations are received clearly in Qatar then who would listen to 97.5?
Q1250_C10	Exactly Just like the local newspapers you would probably get very little information worth listening to on this station. Perhaps try tuning to the French service of QBS
Q1250_C11	its there in the arabic its there in the arabic service.
Q1250_C12	Why would they report traffic Why would they report traffic news?  It's the same reason why weather reporting is not big business.  The report would be--heavy congestion at every round about, multiple accents, crazy drivers in little pick-ups, aggressive drivers in LCs and large trucks generally being moronic.  In other words, it's lethal out there so drive something large and pray a lot.
Q1250_C13	The truth is simple but The truth is simple but seldom ever seen. QBS isn't a 'News Channel'! It's an amateur radio station and serves as an alibi. Don't expect anything and you'll be fine.

Q1251	Doha School Places September 2012 Hi everyone, my Husband has just got a Job with Qatar Airways and i'm hoping to get my three children into a British School in Doha in September 2012, i need a place in Year 3, Year 2 and Reception. can anybody advise on how likely that is ? i'm not sure if i should stay in the UK until i can get the children into a School or could that be a really long wait ??? any information would be greatly received, Many Thanks XX
Q1251_C1	My personal advice Wait and only apply to Doha English Speaking School.  If they get accepted then leave the UK.  This school is only British school which follow the actual British curriculum and is monitored by the British educational council.  All the rest of the British school claim they "follow" the British curriculum.  Who is there to monitor the school?  If you PAY for a private company to accredit the school, they will come out and give you accreditation. You will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools don't have the textbooks for each subject in the class.  Nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals.  Sadly, the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the Principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints.
Q1251_C2	DESS although the best has DESS although the best has LONGGGGG waiting list and is until primary. For me , no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place. To me there are other good ones like Doha College, Parkhouse, Sherbourne & Doha British School which you can consider. Due to personal preference, I have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too. Alternatively you let your husband settled here first.. find a school before you guys come over. All schools require entrance exam before they are accepted. So whenever a place becomes available, do prepare to fly them immediately.
Q1251_C3	Apply now Its not easy to find school seat available in Doha so I strongly suggested to apply now. Newton British School and Montessori British School are the best following British Curriculum and the best location (Al Waab/Al Azizya) for western people to live. Good luck  Angelo
Q1251_C4	Any place you can get is Any place you can get is good. Apply to at least 6 schools and keep your fingers crossed. it might take up to 2 years
Q1251_C5	To me , whether you are To me , whether you are coming with your husband a not, you have to start applying now & wait for schools to come back to you with a place. As of now, I can say ALL schools Brit or non Brit are on waiting list mainly due to 2 reasons 1. Influx of new families coming to Doha to work while the existing ones are still here. 2. Existing people are transferring schools to their desired schools or so called better schools. So for schools like Doha College & DESS would have super long list. Heard that there are people waited for 2 years to get into DESS.  Nevertheless, don't get upset over this as I believe they picked the names by random & also by academic results. So all u need to do is first to submit yr apps & pray that you get picked for an entrance exam. And don't worry about the entrance exam. It's very easy and nothing that ordinary kids cannot do.Another thing that you need to do is to call them up periodically to check for spaces available after you have submitted them. Last but not least, if you really have to come here with your hb, take whichever school that can offer you place & wait for your desired on to be available. Tat's what everyone did here in Doha actually.
Q1251_C6	Thank you Bral1960! Thank you Bral1960!
Q1251_C7	Entrance Exams .... Thank You, Minie....  That was a very useful post.... I was worried about the entrance exam, my boys are straight A student's at thier current school, but i didn't know what the Doha Schools would expect of them ?    I'm hoping that the exam's are sat in a nice environment and the children don't feel any pressure, i want the whole move to Qatar to be positive, so fingers crossed,   Sarah xxx
Q1251_C8	Hi Redline,my husband got a Hi Redline,my husband got a job for QA as well and we are moving to Doha in May! We are on the same boat!!!!The best think to do is to apply NOW for all the schools.Newton British School might have a place for your children....just start with any school you can find and then  wait for your desired school! Good luck!!!!
Q1251_C9	Your husband can apply for Your husband can apply for the kids while you and them wait in the UK. If there is no movement on the waiting list then obviously you don't want to give up their places in the UK. To be fair it is probably harder to get your kids into a good public school in the Uk than DESS. People are coming and going from Qatar as there is only so much time you can spend here.  The quality of DESS is OK, but the teachers do tend to concentrate on the better kids. There is also considerable bias and confidentially can also be breached. Codes of conduct and ethics are more relaxed here.
Q1251_C10	Thanks for that, we will see Thanks for that, we will see how thing's shape up....
Q1251_C11	Schools My husband also works for Qatar Airways. Now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for Sept 2012. I am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school. We arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so I had to home teach for a while. However, this time last year we got our daughter into Doha College. She has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school. The school has recently been inspected and did extremely well. They use the British Curriculum so the transition from UK to Doha College was very easy! Your children will need to sit an assessment but it's nothing to worry about. You will also need previous school reports from their current UK school. Other schools that we were impressed with were DESS and Sherbourne. Hope that helps! Good luck! :)
Q1251_C12	schools I disagree with Expatemily (I am a friend in real life with her) Park House is a great school. Also loads of Qatar Airway people. I have 3 kids in the school. Other good schools (based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments) are Doha (Montisori) British School; Doha Collage, Doha English Speaking School. These four schools are also "reasonably" priced. The American schools are crazy expensive. I suggest applying to all of those schools now (as in today!). Places often open up over the summer and Park House requires a deposit on next year from current students in May for September so you could still easily get places. Having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list.
Q1251_C13	Who's School is best Everytime I log on here and see comments about schools I chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed. To date I believe there might be about 6 "best" schools in doha, based on what, usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment. It seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school "it must be the school". A well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what I have come across so far most of the schools are okay, as long as they are not for profit...we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism. Of course places are tight but I dont think people should stress as much about the schools. I have a child of 13 who will either go to DBS or DC but personally I would have him in ASD (no chance) but not because the rest are rubbish just because I personally got a better feeling about the ethos of the school.
Q1251_C14	I agree with John..... Everybody reckons their school is the BEST!  My kids (Year 7 & Year 5) go to DBSM and I have no knowledge of such large class sizes nor any deviation from the British curriculum - a friend of mine teaches there and she is clear that what they teach is the same as home?  They kids recieved excellent text books and stuff.  There are horror stories about most of the schools mentioned above (prob including DBSM!) and as many "Best" schol tags for the same schools - it is down to personal preference and experience.
Q1251_C15	Thank You ......... Thank You everyone for your quick reply's, i'm going to start applications today to all the schools and hope for the best XXX
Q1251_C16	Hi, my kids go to DBS as Hi, my kids go to DBS as well, year 2, 3 and 5 none of the classes are overcrowded all have around 24 per class - they do follow the British Corriculem and would go as far to say they are a year ahead of the kids in England.
Q1251_C17	Best of luck with you school Best of luck with you school applications, I have heard all the British Schools are full even for September so would recommend not coming out until you have places for all of them at the same school.
Q1251_C18	Not strictly true, they are Not strictly true, they are opening a new class in each year, we have got a place in yr three for our daughter and the class size will be 22
Q1251_C19	What school ? Is the above School at your talking about Cedars ?   Sarah x
Q1251_C20	Check out Loydence Academy, Check out Loydence Academy, English curriculum to a high standard. New campus opened September 2011 at Al Aziziyah, very small class sizes but growing weekly.
Q1251_C21	Becareful if you have gifted Becareful if you have gifted children, places like Park House, Newton etc are not able to provide any additional support and your child will not make any progress
Q1251_C22	Gifted Children Be careful if you have children, simonsmithy, because your child will not have much support and not make any progress without dedicated teachers and a school with good facilities. The truly gifted children in Doha are those who have been given the gift of a place at a decent school. Can you please tell me the name of a school in Doha that does not have entrance tests? And why do they have entrance tests, simonsmithy? All schools have entrance tests in order to keep out children with special educational needs. In this respect, Park House is no better or worse than any other school.
Q1251_C23	I know kids who have got into I know kids who have got into Dess without entrance tests - just reports. Same for sherborne, PHES, newton etc . All based on UK reports and no tests
Q1251_C24	Entrance tests You are mistaken,simonsmithy. Most children who are trying to gain a place at most schools in Doha have to sit some sort of entrance test. I know the lady who arranges the tests at one of the Newton schools, so I know that, as usual, you have got your facts wrong. Perhaps some children who do come from "prominent" schools in the UK might not have to be put through a test, but these are exceptions rather than the rule.
Q1251_C25	I think it's best not to I think it's best not to accept anything but your preferred school, the transition from the childs home country school is hard enough but to have to then go and uproot them again after they've made friends and settled in isn't really fair on the child.  Please don't despair with my comments just trying to be realistic, it's your decision at the end of the day.  Doha is great by the way and you and your family will love it once you're all out here and settled.
Q1251_C26	DC AND DESS.......... Thank you for your comments......  DC and DESS are my two favourite School's and i have applied for both..... I have no idea if i have any chance at all at getting them in any time soon ????   Sarah XXX
Q1251_C27	PS Michelle, i totally agree PS Michelle, i totally agree with only putting my children into one school and not changing them to my preferred Choice when a place become available. My Children will already have to leave all thier friends behind in the UK and i don't want to make them do it again once in Doha.  Sarah XXX
Q1251_C28	You have to Thanks Simon,   You have to try though, maybe more chance with Sherbourne ?   Sarah
Q1251_C29	I have registered for Park I have registered for Park house this year and they told me that they received over 600 applications in 2 days. However, I just applied online anyhow. They came back to me & told me that my kids are unlikely to be selected due to the long wait list. Anyhow you can try. Prob you have better luck. You only change school if you are not happy with the school for whatever the reason is.
Q1251_C30	Possible Solution As a possible short term solution you could try Cedars. We had our child enrolled there for a couple of terms whilst we were on a waiting list for another school. As an Australian family we had additional problems because our academic year doesn't match up with the UK system.  The standard of teaching is excellent (almost all teachers are British) and the class sizes are small. To be honest, if if wasn't for the fact that their building is too small to offer PE etc. we would have left our child enrolled there.  Anyway, just a thought. I know from experience how frustrating the whole schooling situation is here. Good luck.
Q1251_C31	schools I couldn't agree with you more. How can you send your child to a school without seeing it?!x

Q1251_C35	Newton is British? I am sorry, Tracy.C.Marriott, but I do not understand. Are you suggesting that Newton International Schools - there are in fact three schools, not one - are British schools and that they are not in fact "international" schools? Or that they only employ British teachers? Or that they follow the English National Curriculum, even though Arabic and Islamic Studies are not actually part of the English National Curriculum? Or maybe that all of the students are British? What exactly are you saying?

Q1251_C40	Compass International School, Al Khor Redline944 There is a brand new international school that most people don't yet know about - Compass International School, Al Khor. It opened this past January. It follows the British curriculum and the IPC. The classes are capped at 22 students. If you live at the Pearl, it is an easy 25 minute drive up to Al Khor, and the school offers bus service from the Pearl and Zig Zag towers. I can say quite truthfully that the British curriculum is followed with fidelity because I am one of the teachers there. I love it, and so do the other staff and the students. The teachers there live to teach, and the students are engaged and thriving. I don't mean to sound sales-y but I am quite passionate about our little slice of Qatar! Feel free to ask me any questions.  www.cisalkhor.com
Q1251_C41	My husband and I are moving My husband and I are moving to Doha very shortly. We are waiting for our visas to be issued and are hoping to come over mid-October. We have 3 children, they will be going into years 5, 4 and 2 in September here in the UK.  A lot of people have suggested putting their names down for schools from now however we are a bit confused as to whether this is possible given that we do not have our visas, residence permits etc as yet. Do the schools accept applications without the kids actually being resident in Doha?  What do you advise?  We are very keen on moving as a family, however, although we're not too fussy, from previous experience I am not keen on home-schooling :-)
Q1251_C42	school choices We went through a similar experience recently where we had to choose a school for our son. We read many stories and received advice; all very confusing.  So we visited the schools that had availability and chose the one that we felt was most suitable after interviewing the headmaster. I think it is beneficial to have your children with you in Doha when school-hunting. The entrance tests will need to be undertaken if there is a place available. My son is enrolled at Newton International Lagoon (he is 15 yrs old) and we are looking forward to the opportunity he has and face it with a positive attitude. I trust you find a school that has availability and that resonates with you and your family.

Q1273	where can I find acai berry in doha? It seems that Acai berry is fantastic for diet
Q1273_C1	RE: where can I find acai berry in doha? <strong> Hi there! My name is Dana, and I am from Bahrain. I read this post and followed the advice of jamesarl & bmw528 and ordered some acai berry to Doha over the internet. I just wanted to share my experience with you.  I ordered 5 bottles of acai berry health supplement, and it took 6 days to arrive at my office. from: www.acaiberryboutique.com  I took the supplements to my physician and doctor, she also uses the same supplement (acai berry pure) for her health. She had never ordered online, instead she used to buy them when she was in the US or have friends bring them over. She compared the stuff I got from the acai berry boutique (the online store) to the stuff she got in stores in the States, and she said the quality was MUCH better from the online store.   We both read a lot of blogs and articles before buying online. There are lots of ways to check quality (color, taste, feel, texture, density etc) and my doctor said the online stuff was significantly better. She is also recommending it to her patients now for things like joint pain, inflammation, digestive system, and healthier body shape.   I would also recommend you buy the product online, because it is higher quality than what you can get in stores here, and in most places in the States. They ship very quickly for a site located in America, and the prices are very good for such a supplement.  Thank you jameearl and bmw528 for your recommendation. www.acaiberryboutique.com was an excellent place to buy acai berry!  <strong>

Q1273_C3	RE: where can I find acai berry in doha? http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&rid=148624  Acai Berry Scam: Dark Side Of Online Marketing  Consumers losing money not weight, the truth about acai berries is now exposed for the masses   Acai berry has been known to have countless health benefits but with no relevant data to support the fact. Despite the lack of data, modern day people have embraced acai berries as their next best thing to lose weight and gain a healthy body, skin and digestive system. But the truth is that acai berry benefits are overrated.  Acai palm, derived from the Euterpe genre of palm cultured in the Brazilian rain forests is known to have antioxidant properties, which is true. But the antioxidants need to be as good for health as it is presented to the common man. Also, as acai berry is not directly consumed by human beings, more than half the beneficial properties of the fruit go in vain. After processing and converting the berries into supplements, it is presented in the form of dietary pills, concentrated juices, beverages, instant drinks, smoothies, yoghurts or is eaten whole as a fruit. When taken as a whole fruit, the benefits are genuine, but not otherwise.  Acai berry scam has been exposed today because of the scientific data that reveals that there has not been any research or investigation about the claimed benefits of the fruit. Producers of acai supplements have presented unproven claims and declarations to people about the health benefits of the fruit and its antioxidant properties, but these are all unsubstantial claims. The truth is that acai berries have only very negligible amounts of antioxidant, which is quite less than what you can find in other types of berries and fruits.  It needs to be brought to light that there are no such benefits of acai berries that scientists could have pointed out. Acai berry and products made from the same have not earned an approval from the FDA, and the potency of these products is questionable.  There have been many talk shows and conferences regarding the false claims of acai berry as a weight loss supplement, yet people are simply reluctant to acknowledge the fact that acai berries are simply not acceptable according to medical and scientific terms.  Many consumers of acai products have actually suffered from health complication in the recent past. It should be considered as awareness for the masses, as acai berry products have almost flooded the market today. Despite the warnings and acai berry scams revealed on the internet every other day, still there seems to be a lack of communication that needs to be bridged.  Internet has had a great influence in marketing acai berry products. However, it has also contributed in revealing the acai berry scams, which people have often overlooked. As companies come up with potential free trail offers, customers fall prey to these lucrative offers and accept them. In the quest to try out these products, they often end up endangering their health.  Acai berries does not have any miraculous properties; it is just like any other fruit that has not been researched or scientifically tested to have any medicinal properties.  The only presence of antioxidants does not make it a weight loss product as well. Hence, prevention is advised.  For further information on this, you can see: http://www.acaiberry-info.com/acaiberry_scams.htm
Q1273_C4	RE: where can I find acai berry in doha? I got my acai berry in 5 business days from this online site - acai berry boutique. I definitely recommend it to others wanting this supplement in Qatar.   The stuff you get at supermarkets and GNC is junk here compared to this online site. Even take a look at the content, you will see its only less than 10%, but online site has PURE acai berry capsules, with 100% extract concentration. Results come much faster.   I recommend it to others.
Q1273_C5	RE: where can I find acai berry in doha? <b><strong> the best place to buy Acai Berry is online! check out www.AcaiBerryBoutique.com (The Acai Berry Boutique) It is a great place to buy acai berry, they sell 100% pure, natural and organic acaiberry products, and they ship to Qatar. I have used them several times before for ordering to Doha, and would highly recommend them to all.... hope it works for you, enjoy! <strong><b>

Prepaid Internet cards in Qatar are issued to only those people who already have a Credit Card even if you have an account with the bank.  Why it should be linked to "Credit" when the payment is "prepaid"? Beats me.

Q1279	How do we improve std of education ? ... My children didn't get good results this time from board exam. In BFPS results are pathetic. Because, lady principal send good qualified teacher to Pakistan. She is doing trial and error experiments with our children's future. How do we improve std of our childrens education?
Q1279_C1	I don't want to be harsh but I don't want to be harsh but parent are equally responsible for inculcating proper educational values in a child. Parent should be more involved with the education of the child even if they are busy. Qatar is a place where you cannot rely completely on the teaching staff and tutoring the child is quite expensive. Unless the child is exceptionally talented he/she needs parental guidance.
Q1279_C2	Sorry to hear about the Sorry to hear about the result of your children; ...Which exams you're talking about? Federal Board Exams are proceeding these days...but you're mentioning the results. Are your children studying in the other stream the Cambridge System?
Q1279_C3	What do you mean by "didn't What do you mean by "didn't get good results" ?  Can you tell us how bad was the performance?
Q1279_C4	I think your intention is to I think your intention is to criticize the lady principal. 9th and 10th stander Exam still not over and 11th -12th  exams will start on 4th next month, what you mean by board exam. In BFPS results are pathetic.  Which board announces result when exam is yet to start?
Q1279_C5	I agree with MOM_ME I agree with MOM_ME here...  No school is either good or bad and yes there may be good and bad teachers given that in this part of the world its very diff to get qualified and experienced teachers as they are paid peanuts.  BUT that being said we as parents are also in many ways responsible for the education of our children. Just studying the lessons in School arent enough. when they come home see that they revise their work everyday and do their home work on their own. Guide them properly and give them good books to read to expand their knowledge.  A teacher only GUIDES the child. and if the teacher has not explaind the chapter well or you feel the child needs more then try to do the same at home or hire a tutor to help your child.  That being said - every child has their limitations. We shudnt expect our children to perfom miracles nor bring in 100% results all the time. Just encourage your child to do better than the last time every time he sits for an exam and try NOT to create any PANIC or TENSION. every exam shud be approached with a cool head and DONT encourage your child to memorize. Teach them to UNDERSTAND the subject and study.  That not only creates an interest but retention power is more.
Q1279_C6	Sorry, I thought the 'std' in Sorry, I thought the 'std' in the OP meant something else.
Q1280	how good is rising star kindergarten? hi everyone, please i would like to know from  personal experiences how good rising star kindergarten is.  A friend told me all they do is watch TV all day. I went there during the holidays to check and I actually saw TV's in the class but I would like to know from anyone whose kids have been to RSK their personal experiences. I really do appreciate your sincere and candid opinions.
Q1280_C1	RE: how good is rising star kindergarten? <P>Hi Rising Stars Kindergarten is excellent! I think you have beeen misinformed by your friend regarding the children watching tv all day. Children who arrive early before classes commence are supervised in the tv room. At the end of the day&nbsp;children go to the tv room if they have not been picked up on time! Parents appreciate this service as there is no extra charge.You say you went to check in the holidays and every class has a tv in it.&nbsp;I don't know which kindergarten you visited but it certainly was not Rising Stars. The only tv is in the tv room. During the holidays a summer camp was in progress!&nbsp; I invite you to visit Rising Stars anytime then please post a&nbsp;valid and truthful&nbsp;comment.</P>
Q1280_C2	RE: how good is rising star kindergarten? <p>Really surprised to hear this comment, my Son goes to RSK and he has really excelled since we enrolled him there. They have only one TV room like any other kindergarten, So I do not understand where "TV's" come from?</p><p>I think you have been misinformed!!</p>
Q1280_C3	RE: how good is rising star kindergarten? Hello,  My daughter went to this kindergarten and it was appalling, they have one TV room. However, it seems the teachers leave the children there. I did not like this kindergarten at all, there are no British teachers. I tried to communicate with the manager who smelt like she had been smoking, her mannerism was very unprofessional. Upon communication with the teachers, it seemed none of them had any experience or a bachelors degree. This nursery is a disgrace to the British system, such a shame.
Q1280_C4	RE: how good is rising star kindergarten? My kid goes to this Kindergarten and she is happy there. Sorry but it seems that your comments are too personal. You obviously had some personal bad intention by making this comments and anyone can see that.
Q1280_C5	RE: how good is rising star kindergarten? I don't really get where Kiwi is getting her info from. I think it's a 'disgrace' and 'shameful' that she is trying to incite hate when she is so clearly misinformed. I also don't know why she is commenting on a post from a year ago. I smell sour grapes.   Anyways I'm only commenting because I read her/his reply and I am appalled by why he/she is trying to slander such a lovely kindergarten. My son goes to Rising Stars and it has by far exceeded my expectations. Everyone is friendly and polite, and the manager has always been professional in my presence. The children are definitely not left in the TV room all day, I have been at different times of the morning to pick up my son (we travel a lot) and he has always been in the classroom with his teacher.   Also to my knowledge they do follow the British curriculum for a kindergarten, and my son has flourished since attending. He cries when he is sick and can't go to school. As for your comment about 'British teachers', again as far as I know, they aren't all British but they are all English native speakers (apart from the Arabic teacher and assistants).   I don't really want to sound like an ad for Rising Stars or waste my time on a post that was made a year ago, so I would urge people to see for themselves what it is like, as my husband and I are extremely pleased with it.

Q1286_C1	RE: What is the best apartment building to live in at a... There are a lot of places that fit this description, with the exception of reasonable, of course. Rents in Doha are about 4 times what they are in the US and that is mostly because employers pay the bills. Is your husband's company not covering housing? How about school tuition? These are considered standard perks in Doha. I would suggest coming to see first. You REALLY don't want to rent sight unseen here. There are too many nasty surprises.

Q1287_C2	RE: Visiting Qatar on Visit Visa or Business Visa after... Uarif,  I was in this situation recently and I can assure you, from personal experiences, that without NOC you cannot enter the country on a visit or business visa. If your family is still in Doha (Father, Mother, Brother etc) you can enter on a family visit visa which is valid for one month extendable upto six months. That is the only option that you have.   Of course, if you are holding another GCC RP, then you can enter with an on-arrival visa (provided your profession falls in the eligible category). Make sure that the first time you fly to Doha in this instance, you fly via the national carrier i.e. Qatar Airways.  Hope this was helpful.

Q1300	Why gold price increasing? Gold price is steadily increasing.   Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?
Q1300_C1	RE: Why gold price increasing? Because IMF just sell a record quantity of gold to the Central bank of India and look like China will follow suit. Also because people are nervous about holding on to the US dollar due to the US inflation rate and the perceived slowness of recovery compared to the other economy.  Bad news for those receiving their income in US dollar or other currencies fixed-pegged to the greenback (such as Qatari Riyals)
Q1300_C2	RE: Why gold price increasing? Its because the dollar is tumbling and festival and marriage season in India
Q1300_C3	RE: Why gold price increasing? it is the international trend; recently India bought a significant quantity of gold and it seems to go on buying, from FMI; so the price grows up. Check the international market trend, now is around 1100 US$/ounce, after the FMI sold cca 1/2 from it's reserve of cca 400 tons gold. Will increase in my opinion, too, because in crisis everybody invests in gold.
Q1300_C4	RE: Why gold price increasing? Low dollar price pushes up the gold price as a hedge against possible future inflation.
Q1300_C5	RE: Why gold price increasing? Due to high demand of gold in India & other country because of festival and safe money to invest.

You will need:  1) babygro for baby,  2) Hat 3) Scratch mitts 4) Clothes and toiletries for yourself - INCLUDING a bit of makeup as this will make you feel better when your hormones are all over the place. 5) Light blanket for baby 6) Extra nappies and milk/bottles incase of emergency (hospital staff to busy to get your something asap) 7) Maternity pads and breast pads for yourself - with a few changes of underwear. 8) As hospitals are boring...maybe a book for yourself?  Its better to be prepared with everything than not have anything when you REALLY need it.

Q1331_C6	And it is related to "lifestye". It is not all, but most. And it is related to "lifestye". They can't afford Boss and Channel, and Qatar can't afford to replace them with higer paid Europeans or even Arabs.  It is not just the nuclear scientists who do what others generally can not do. It is also "a public road sweeper does, what others can not generally do".  Hope you got it.
Q1331_C7	reysaj I can bash every reysaj I can bash every country in the world over one issue or another here, but you don't always have to do what you can... Just my thoughts..  Jackfrost I can get it from most of your posts that you are a very intelligent man but somehow I think you love provoking others, I always thought you did it to tease the hardliners but still it is unfortunate to see a smart man acting this way..      When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity. - Albert Einstein
Q1331_C8	well I wish people would just stop pointing fingers (and noses) at all these little things...life's much more than that...yes I do agree some of the practices of the people of Asia are well downright disgusting...but generalization is far more disgusting...plus no one is perfect...the people who stink (usually) are those guys who work 10 to 12 hours a day in the sun and earn 600 to 800 riyals a month...can't fault them for not using Boss or Lacoste...give them a break people and thank God every time you come across a less fortunate person...  I am not trying to justify them...but I just feel that just because we have been given the best in life (not by our virtue) does not give us the right to put down some one who is from a lower social strata...  My personal peeve is spitting...when I see someone open a door and spit at a traffic light...my first instinct is to go out and bang the door on his head...but then I count from 1 to 10 and drive on...  Then there is bad breath...I am not even going to open my mouth regarding this...:)  I am sorry Jackfrost...I've never been in your position...and I hope I never have to...

Q1331_C12	Rezy I lived with sardars Rezy I lived with sardars for 25 years ( though i am not one) and they are the cleanest people I ever met      When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second.

Q1331_C53	Please be calm , guys! You know guys I'd appreciate the time you gave into discussion of my thread. But I see someone is hurt or someone is pointing another.  As an author, I would like to apologize for posting this topic because I felt responsible for unpleasant responses from other people. Its like somebody is throwing raze of fireball. Please let us not do that. My main purpose of this is to gather views about proper hygiene to which helpful to the people involve who are unaware to have the foul-smelling odor in their bodies.   I am very unfortunate that I don't have a PC of my own so I can't check my threads every now and then.  You know it happens that I have many co-workers coming from those countries (opps...I'm not pointing a particular nationality) that have a foul-smell. They are not just ordinary workers huh, they are supervisors.... That's why I'm so disgusted and I'm trying to avoid them and even holding my breath when encountering them.  I hope the Mowasalat company would also encourage their drivers to be clean and defeinitely be free from the foul-smelling odor as they are serving the public because I've observeD that there drivers have a stink odor too....  Guys, you can try this simple tip to lessen the foul-smelling odor of your colleage in the workplace:  1. Please advise him/her to use a very cheap deodorant like Tawas or Potassium Alum. Do it in a secret and gentle manner. A variuos kind of deodorant is available in the market.  2. Try to offer him/her a presents with a soap and deodorant inside. Use your initiative to do it so that the person is not offended.  Above all, LET US MAKE PEACE, NOT WAR.

Q1338_C1	Samsung Omnia Samsung Omnia I is available in Carrefour Citycentre for QR1850.  What features does Omnia II have over Omnia I?
Q1338_C2	Yeah I guess both are quite amazing ... However, if you are interested in HD2, I have one for sale. Contact me if you are interested.  To mention some benefits of HD2 over Omnia II:  HD2 has a scratch resistant screen (Glass covered) HD2 has 448 MB RAM. Omnia II only has 256 MB. HD2 has multi touch input gestures. HD2 will be upgradeable to windows mobile 7, omnia II won't be.  HD2 has a 1Ghz Snap Dragon (Qualcom) processor. It is not just 200 Mhz faster, it's ligtning fast compared to Samsung proprietary 800 Mhz !!   And yes, Samsung has a better screen display (AMOLED), but AMOLED will wear out with time and its brightness will reduce with time. Everything comes with a price.  Hope this helps. Adeel Ali

Q1347	Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I saw many cars parked under UDC tower. Does anybody know if people start living in the pearl ?  As an apartment owner in the pearl, I fed up with the postponing of the handover date...
Q1347_C1	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Why not contact UDC, if they are your developer, to get a clear picture (good or bad), rather than rely on others, who may or may not be well-informed and could be giving you accurate information or idle speculation?   I am also an investor in The Pearl, and have found, in all my dealings with UDC (ie the people at the Oyster), that they are very professional, helpful and transparent. They will tell you the situation as it stands now, progress and delays, because it is in their interests to ensure that investors have confidence in them and their project.   My apartment is in Viva Bahriya, so not due for completion yet. It is hard to wait, because once you've been down and seen for yourself the scope of the project, you just want to move in and enjoy sitting on your balcony overlooking the sea. Ignore the snipers, stay cool, it will be worth the wait!
Q1347_C2	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I know it is hard to wait, especially given the current economic uncertainty, but none of us (including the developer and the banks) could have predicted what has happened, on a global scale, over the last few months, so we are all having to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally made the investment.  As any investment is about confidence, it doesn't make sense to 'talk down' the project, or encourage rumours about how awful the project is. If you look at other threads on this subject, you can see that those directly involved in the construction are all proud of it: only those unconnected but with 'inside knowledge' ( ie from friends of friends) are predicting doom.  Again, I suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan.
Q1347_C3	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? No one lives at the Pearl yet.   As there is no water or electricity services yet.  UDC and Kharamma are locked in a power struggle over costs and the poor buyers of flats are the losers.
Q1347_C4	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Having followed up with UDC, I have learned that the issue with the power supply was in fact resolved almost 2 weeks ago and they expect people to be living in Porto Arabia by the end of May. Please don't take my word for this, (after all I could just be another one spreading rumors),check with them yourself to see how your property fits into the schedule. Hope it goes well for you!
Q1347_C5	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? I talked to UDC and they said their towers will be opened in May. Electricity and water problems are solved and ready for all porto arabia. I guess in the 4th Quarter of this year, most of the towers will be opened.  I was in Abu Dhabi at the weekend and stayed in one of my friends apartment. His apartment is having a magnificent sea view next to beach(like the apartment in the pearl). It gives me some idea how the life will be in the pearl; simply "dolce vita!!!". Most of the people living in Doha cannot imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be completed, I am sure it will be one of the dream place to live in.   So, we waited a lot but I guess it will worth it!
Q1347_C6	RE: Is there anybody living in the Pearl ? Istavrit,  I was down there this week as well and totally amazed at the progress, especially with the shops (OK, just need the money to buy), cafes and landscaping. The waterfront is beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in Doha, more reminiscent of Palm Beach or parts of Europe. The project is really moving on and taking shape.

Q1350_C2	RE: American expat area I have been wondering this also . . . I see lots of British and Canadian folks . . . I know there has to be some Americans here . . . must be an underground thing.
Q1350_C3	RE: American expat area All of Doha is safe.  Everyone here is mixed nationalities.   It's much more fun that way!  What's the point of going abroad if you don't want to meet other cultures?    I am American, working for an American company, but on my company compound my neighbors are from all over the world.    Most companies place their employees in housing (easiest and cheapest way to go.)   Only place to avoid is the Industrial area, but since you are lucky enough not to be a 3rd world laborer, you have no worries there.  Enjoy Doha

Q1355_C4	RE: how to open a kindergarden school on private basis? I assume you are planning to set up kindergarden school (Nursery) at your villa right?   1) First of all, I do not think you can open something commercial business while you are residing in the same villa (you got to acquire new villa/building which should be vacant)  2) Of course for any business in Qatar, you need a Qatari Sponsor (even WLL or Qatari Proprietorship)  3) Then usual documentation like Chamber of Commerce (for name registration), Commercial Registration, Rental Agreement, Municipality Inspection/Approval, Computer Card, Labour Ministry Registration etc.   If WLL, you may have to go to Ministry of Economics & Commerce for the registration of Articles of Association (Partnership Deed).  The documentation either you can do it on your own going step by step or can hire the services (PRO) against payment.  Hope you must have got some idea, all the best.

Furnishing an appartment will take around 4,000 and more, food & beverage around 2,000 - 3,000. And then u have transportation if you will use a bus one way ticket is 3 qr the cab minimum around 18/trip depends on the distance but it is extreemle hard to find a cab sometimes so you will have regular people stop to pick u up (for money off course, around 30 qrs minimum, u can book a cab on the phone :), so you will need around GBP 2,700....

Q1362_C2	RE: i am a filipino expat, i want to ask what are the... here are some things that might help.   firstly, the bare minimum stuff.  1) salary of 7000 or higher (sometimes they approve for 6000 also). 2) six months bank statement with salary transfer. 3) you need to be an rp holder. 4) your designation on visa shld be respectable. something like engineer or doctor or manager or accountant etc.    believe me point 4 is the most important. i have a friend who earns 15k per month, but due to lack of visas his company had given him a field operator visa for temp purposes, and now he is not able to sponser his wife.   now that you got the basics straight... you need a few documents.  1) go to some arabic typing guys near sofitel (there are lots of them there). 2) they have a sample of no objection certificate. get it typed in arabic with your details. 3) get the offer letter (they have sample) also typed from them. 4) get 3 copies of 2&3 and get them signed and sealed from ur sponsor. 5) take those docs to the labour department and submit them. they will keep 1 copy and return you 2 more. keep 1 for yourself and give 1 to your employer / sponsor.   if you already have a 6 month bank statement, then you can readily apply for an rp. if not, you can get your wife here on a visit visa and later convert it to rp.   to apply for or visit visa, get the visa form filled (from same sofitel place) and take it to any visa centre (meisaimer center is good as it has good number of counters).   all the best.

Q1372	Vitamin D Dear all, anyone can educate me about Vitamin D. I am found deficient and even after a month of medication havent had a good result.  But i have also noticed that it seems to be a regional profile , a lot of other women i know have a deficient profile.  Thanks
Q1372_C1	thanks thanks drsam. do you know if deificiency can cause low mood, anxiety etc
Q1372_C2	the link between Vitamin D the link between Vitamin D deficeincy and depression (bipolar disorder, low-mood...) exists.   scientific studies place hypovitD as a risk factor, not a triggering causal factor of depression.   tableF-6 Evidence Map for Neuropsychological Functioning page 1022  http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050&page=1022
Q1372_C3	Polly, I'm sure the doctor Polly, I'm sure the doctor might have suggested you weekly tablets and injection for vitamin D's deficiency. You should add some nutritious food in your diet, take full cream milk, mixed fruit salad, vegetables especially beet root... it will improve your condition ISA.
Q1372_C4	Vitamin D is used by the body Vitamin D is used by the body to process calcium for the bones. It's naturally occurring when you're in the sunlight.  I strongly suggest that you take a walk after you eat right before sunset.  Make sure that you eat calcium containing products (milk, cheese) as well as items from all the food groups (vegetables, meat, dairy).  If you are lactose intolerant, try taking calcium supplements. It's best if u allow your body to produce vitamin D naturally instead of taking medication.
Q1372_C5	Hi PollyJ This is very common in Doha now a days,causes yet to know.But frankly speaking you did not mention here how much the value you have at present by the blood test revealed.As I do practice here first re-place the insuficiency by injections why ? ofcourse the potiency of the drug will rapidly get to the noraml target i.e. 30-8o. Your doctor will investigate why you have this deficiency could be any reason for that. Exposer to Sun will just normally help every one but sudden low should be properly investigate.Till then cheers !!
Q1372_C6	Hi Shinewood , I am at a Hi Shinewood , I am at a score of around 10 and this after a medication of 1.5 months. Can vit d deficiency cause depression like symptoms? My doctors feel i may have an absorption issue.  thanks all for responding
Q1372_C7	PollyJ This is what i would like to say earlier may be you have an issue of absorption problem.Not only depression may take you many other problems
Q1372_C8	This is bizzare! The sunlight This is bizzare! The sunlight triggers Vitamin D production. Isn't there enough sun here? Of course, if you cover up, you'll have to suffer.
Q1372_C9	if the UV index is 2, 30 min if the UV index is 2, 30 min in the sun exposing as much of ur skin, twice aweek at noon. UV2 IN DOHA: from november to february. UV=3 10 min 2 times a week at noon. uv3 in doha: sept, oct, march, april at noon summer before 11:00 and after 15:00
Q1372_C10	drsam...thats great info. drsam...thats great info. Noted.
Q1372_C11	however all official studies however all official studies can't recommend sunlight exposure for vit D since toomany risks (DNA deterioration, cancer skin, sun stroke, eye problems...) and to many parameters (skin color, location, time, UV index,...)  these official studies stress on the intake or vit D. for the ultime reference (a 1100+ pages) that sum up all researches, and all previous studies: http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050 not for faint hearted tho! have a look.
Q1372_C12	It mainly affects local woman It mainly affects local woman as they cover up too much. Vit D is produced natuarally by your body on exposure to sun light. Only in extreme cases should you need supplements.

I used to buy it in the UK although it is difficult to get hold of for exactly the reason you mention....  I used to make air dried hams, bacons etc, and saltpetre kills botulsim and keeps the meat a nice pink colour.   I am wanting to make Kadid which is arabic air dried mutton, to make a tasty couscous!   There must be some kind of chemical supply co. here.....
Q1376_C5	RE: Where can I buy Saltpetre / Potassium Nitrate? You will need a special permit to bring any dual use chemical into the country, including:  1. Civil Defense + Environmental Commission + Municipality approved storage facility  2. Importation of hazardous substances must be specifically mentioned on company CR. You cannot import hazardous substances in your personal capacity.  3. In addition to the above, you will need to submit HAZMAT data sheet along with import documents to customs with civil defense and environmental approval with each and every consignment.  4. If material is classified as explosive or highly flammable, you will also need to have the documents approved by ministry of interior (police).  This applies to anything from paint thinner to you name.
Q1376_C6	RE: Where can I buy Saltpetre / Potassium Nitrate? Wow thanks.....but I don't want to import it - I just want to buy a couple of hundred grammes. You mention that you would need to complete that process to import e.g. paint thinner - however paint thinner is available for retail purchase in stores here, so presumably the restriction is on retailers, not retail buyers.....  There must be a shop out there somewhere!!

Q1378	which do you prefer, Manual or Automatic transmission? Why? lol... just share your thoughts
Q1378_C1	Sports Car, manual is Sports Car, manual is great..  Ordinary car, especially in Doha traffic, I prefer automatic..
Q1378_C2	with this much traffic in with this much traffic in doha waiting in the R/B or step by step in alnasr street in the Thursday evening  the Automatic is the best  But the most  strong gearbox is the manual ones   any way DRIVE SAFE :)      <a title="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"><img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="Everything you need to know about living in Doha, Qatar" /></a>
Q1378_C3	Automatic....anywhere anytime.... Automatic....anywhere anytime....  Why to keep changing gears?   1. In automatic the chances of error during change of gear speed especially at roundabouts is zero.  2. Also with automatic one can use both hands to control the vehicle at R/Abouts and dont have to keep shifting gears thereby giving improved control.  The above 2 add to give one the split second advantage when other driver makes some error and you can either slow down abruptly or give way swiftly.  And of course one can slow down to a halt and then accelerate in an instant without going from 4th gear to 1st and then 2nd and 3rd & finally 4th.  The only advantage manual has is the pickup one can get from 1st gear and the driver decides when to switch to a higher gear and this is usually done faster manually.

Q1378_C15	Intelligent Manual for offroad and Auto for city traffic.  Peace.
Q1378_C16	A/T vs M/T A/T vs M/T:  Automatic gives you more control over the steering wheel (when you are in the middle lane of a 3 Lane R/A) as you can use both hands.  With Automatic also you can save fuel by going into neutral on straight stretches. You can also go into 1st Gear, 2nd Gear & 3rd Gear!!! (this is very useful while going uphill on a long mountainous terrain).  <b/>Thus you can use Automatic as a Manual car but not viceversa</b>  And is there a Cruise Control for manual cars? It has the most fuel savings advantage on long routes.

Q1380_C3	RE: hi,can any one tell me where can we fill the Car A/C... You only need to fill the car aircon if it's not working.  The gas should not leak out in normal use, or disappear, or shrink. If your aircon has stopped working duev to a gas leak, you can re-fill it which may last a few weeks or so - but repairs are needed if your gas is gone.  Should be about QR150 to fill - but it will quickly become cheaper to fix the leak.

If you want to visit the Gulf and have a nice time, try visiting, umm, any place but Doha.  Hotels are too expensive, there is nothing for tourists to do, and the authorities have created rules to ensure that tourists don't have fun.  Basically - tourists aren't wanted here.  Go someplace else.

Q1392	Can films help change society ? Read an interesting article about the power of Film.  The premise is that movies can send a message to the audience and thus help change society.  An example given was "The Blind Side". I saw this film, loved it, but did it help me become a better person ? I don't know..  Recently, someone stated "People get their values from the silver screen."  Would you agree ?
Q1392_C1	since long time Americans are since long time Americans are getting inspiration from their Hollywood, look at Rambo type movies, perhaps they need another episode to capture Osama and Taliban's leader.
Q1392_C2	Yes I do think films have an effect on some a lotta people in society. I did like "The Blind Side", it is a beautiful film and I remember reading an article later about a few people being taken in by that movie and legally adopting afro-american kids like him.  Nomerci is right about the action flicks and well as the chick-flicks.   Rags to riches movies also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get noticed.

Q1392_C12	TheLucyShow.. I got confused, but what i think you're saying that Bollywood influences how people dress.  That's fair enough. But what about sending out a moral/ethical/religious message. Do Bollywood films help you perhaps become a better person ?

Q1392_C15	Supeesh.. Did you ever watch Gandhi or Dune ?
Q1392_C16	of course the mass of course the mass media/movie production can change society. But i wouldn't use word "help". "help" is something positive, while mass production can affect society very negatively. Movie can definitely form a certain images, pattern behavior, stereotypes, etc. All Film companies reduce the number of smoking scenes in their films, some of them have banned these scenes completely. Movie creates stereotypes that are followed by people. Girls want to look, to be dressed and to behave as their favorite actress. Guys want to act like their hero acts. This is normal  process. Brit, one separate movie might not help one individual become better (but also MIGHT help), but creating a whole image of certain behavior and stereotypes in the society definitely can make this society better (or worse)

Q1399	Puppy Any recommendation where to buy a puppy from. I am not very particular on the breed
Q1399_C1	RE: Puppy Contact qaws.org - they will be able to help you out.
Q1399_C2	RE: Puppy Do you have a Plan in place to take the puppy home ?  Please  make sure you do. My self I have found my 2 amazing dogs from Qaws but I always intend to take them home.I see so many people rescue animals and then leave them behind which is not fair on the animal.  A dog can live as long as 18 years and you have to answer the question. Can I commit that long to them?   If you can then go for it as dogs give you so much love :)
Q1399_C3	RE: Puppy I would say QAWS too. We adopted one around 3 weeks ago from there, it was the day after the big fire and we have a great dog. Best not go to a pet shop as I have heard that they DO NOT look after the animals at all.
Q1399_C4	RE: Puppy Defo QAWS. The fire has left so many dogs homeless and without the kindness of all the people who have fostered them they would be on the streets.
Q1399_C5	RE: Puppy As all said, contact QAWs. Much better to adopt dog or puppy from there than buy from a pet shop. Then afterwards when you plan to leave Qatar commit yourself to also take your dog with you, and not leave it behind, struggling to survive and hungry.

Q1401	Basic Islam Is there such a place here in Doha where the newly converts go just learn the basic of Islam like how to perform pray and other basic things that every Muslim should know?  When I checked with Al Fanar back in July 2012, they don't any class for newly converts.  Thank you.
Q1401_C1	You can learn the basics from You can learn the basics from a friend who is a Muslim, I guess.
Q1401_C2	Sis Uphill Oh ok...no idea why that's happening though. Hopefully the mods will sort it out cos I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Barakhallah feeki
Q1401_C3	I seriously doubt about SrK I seriously doubt about SrK and Salman's religions!  Just getting a birth in a muslim family does not make a person muslim, otherwise the son of Prophet Nuh (peace be on Him) would be a muslim.  Everybody needs to strive for knowledge of Islam and implement the rules and discipline in their personal life.
Q1401_C4	Vic Maybe bro maybe...but how will knowing whether or not these stars are Muslims, benefit us? In fact, May Allah protect us, by wasting time trying to find out about their place in Islam, we can commit bigger sins and even lose our Islam, due to our lack of knowledge on things that are far more pressing.  But yes you are right, being born to a Muslim family does not make one a Muslim, and I know this firsthand, sadly, due to the state of my own family and who I was less than ten years back, Astaghfirullah!
Q1401_C5	victory buddy i say let's all keep our houses in order and the rest will automatically fall in place. besides, it is not any person's place to judge others and their standing in Allah's sight. We do not know how Allah judges us. It is possible Salman Khan is more dear to God than you or me because of some small good deed he did sometime. If a 100 time murderer and a prostitute were forgiven and granted heaven for merely watering a thirsty dog, Salman stands a good chance too Allah willing. So yeah let's all pray for each other and keep our own Islam strong:-)
Q1401_C6	fathimah you stated you were 'a certain way ten years back'. i get your intention and am sure you don't plan to anyway but please do not mention any more details of why or how you were a bad or lost muslim. the reason i say that is because people frequently curiously ask for more details..and we in good faith spill all our beans..but Allah frequently veils for us our sins from the world and people because he intends to forgive those sins. I too have been and still am a somewhat lost muslim but alhamdulillah god has shielded all those sins from people and inshallah it will only be between me and him. Thus we should not openly declare what allah has mercifully hidden for us. And I hope we are not hijacking the thread..well we are but not really lol
Q1401_C7	Moh yes you are right Guess my intention of saying so was to specify more why I don't judge people due to y'know.. But you are absolutely right, Jazakhallah khair for your advice. As always we are all in need of one another for advice and help. May Allah truly forgive us all, increase us in knowledge and grant us success in this world and the next..Aameen  And yes that was a hijack, but hopefully it will be viewed as a "good" one!
Q1401_C8	More distractions and love More distractions and love for this materialistic world snatch peace from our lives.  Peace of mind and soul is not easily available. We all need to strive to attain spirituality and peace.

Q1401_C15	fathimah yes when the self proclaimed experts busy themselves with issuing 'fatwas' against film stars and cricketers, the misguided extremism and strife inevitably follow..don't know where you're from but the scholars in India are too pre-occupied with Salman Khan and Zaheer Khan to have any time to educate people on the true Islam. And hey, did you notice how one comment directed the OP to 'QL user Fathima' for info?. As they say, a person's reputation precedes them..mashallah:-)
Q1401_C16	Yes, Mohdata you are right Yes, Mohdata you are right one is to self study but Internet is not the correct options always, due to several mis information about Islam.

Q1403	Canned pumkin for pie? I went to Carrefour (landmark) today looking for stuff for pumpkin pie, but couldnt find pumpkin pie filling anywhere, unless I missed it in some random section. Anyone know if this is available anywhere? And if to last resort, can you buy a real pumpkin anywhere? thanks
Q1403_C1	A friend found some at MegaMart last week. But FYI the pumpkin crop this year was below expectations, so it's been hard to find. I hoard it and always have 2-3 cans on hand.  "If you're looking for sympathy, you'll find it between sh*t and syphilis in the dictionary."   - David Sedaris
Q1403_C2	I agree with boer buy a real I agree with boer buy a real pumpkin
Q1403_C3	Was at megamart on Sunday and was told by staff that it is now all gone.  Initial shipment only lasted about 3 days.  They do expect another shipment next week.  But that's after Thanksgiving.  I have never seen it at any other grocery store in Doha besides Megamart.   If you really need to make pumpkin pie (and what would Thanksgiving be without one!)   then it really is quite easy to buy a whole pumpkin, cut it up and cook it down.  There should be real pumpkins.  I know they have them at Wholesale market and Megamart still.  Check the internet for recipes/directions.  Good luck.
Q1403_C4	i went to mega mart i went to mega mart yesterday - they have loads on a stand by the checkouts
Q1403_C5	You have to stock up before You have to stock up before October. Those danged Canucks have their Thanksgiving early and beat us Yanks out for all the canned pumpkin. I've taken to breaking into their villas and "liberating" the pumpkin for a proper holiday! Mandi

Q1408_C6	Hi ZuperZue!! My names Craig, MD of Mirage Properties here in Qatar.  Regards your queries I can pretty much second what most others have said so far. If you're a single person working in West Bay area then you're better off finding an apartment in a good quality building near to work.  Villa compounds here are usually geared towards family living as most are 4-5 bed+ properties. However, saying that we have just released an apt compound, on Al Waab St, which would give the best of both worlds. Sadly for you, these have all been leased i'm afraid.   If you do opt for a Pearl Apt, or one of the better towers in the business district, you will usually get all the facilities you would find on a compound and be living with like minded people.  When searching for property please be aware that there are 3 types of furnished basis here in Qatar:  Unfurnished (U/F) - means you get nothing, not even kitchen appliances and sometimes no AC either, in very extreme cases and usually in older properties you don't even get kitchen cabinets.  Semi Furnished (S/F) - Kitchen appliances, A/C's and sometimes curtains.  Fully furnished (F/F) - Kitchen appliances, Furniture, Curtains, TV, DVD and sometimes bedding, kitchen utensils, crockery, cutlery etc (but not usual).  Price difference between S/F & F/F is usually around QR1,500 - QR3,000 extra per month.  If you'd like to get an idea of what's available in the market at the moment, please take a look on our site www.mirageproperty.com, which lists a whole range of properties, both exclusive to ourselves and from the open market.  If you see anything you like and want more info, please feel free to contact us through the site and one of my agents will be in contact.  I hope we can be of help.  Kind regards  Craig at Mirage

Q1412	Buying a car outside of Qatar I'm looking to by a new car, but the local GM dealer is useless and looked at me like I'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when I said I wanted a manual gearbox.  So, I've seen the car I want in Dubai.  Is it possible for me to get a loan here, buy the car from Dubai, import and then register it here, or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country?  Thanks
Q1412_C1	Intrest rates Hi Alan, you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan.   If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you.  I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too.  Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)
Q1412_C2	Madilulur, ignore the Mandilulur, ignore the profile, its nonsense.  I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum.  My name isn't Alan either, but it'll do for this forum :)  B2D, driving is always fun, I love cars, always have.  Plus its an adventure, never done it before :)  Cy, I know about the rates, but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different, yes I pay more overall, but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want.  I'm a Brit, I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear.  I bought the car, I'll decide when to change.  Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show, and they still aren't as good as a manual box.  The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them, I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks.  Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox, not a sodding computer. :)
Q1412_C3	Xena, I picked that name Xena, I picked that name because I used to wear glasses that reminded my work colleagues of him :)  I think asking for a manual here is as shocking as asking for a bacon sandwich.
Q1412_C4	Maybe you could get the Maybe you could get the personal loan get the car and then switch to a car loan (for the lower rate?) worth asking about - worst they can do is say no and you're just back to where you are now
Q1412_C5	Auto over manual Ok got one last one in me, been here for 9 years now and have owned 4 cars here just bought my 5th - GMC Denali its an triptronic LOADS OF FUN TO DRIVE AROUND.   As you all have mentioned the reaction that you get when u ask the sales guy for a manual, it is that much more difficult to sell a secound hand manual.   Its much much easier (and gets you a better resale price)to sell an automatic if when you deside to sell for what ever reason.
Q1412_C6	Cy, fair point, well made :) Cy, fair point, well made :)  But I still want a manual.  More expats than locals in this country, so I don't think it will be a massive problem come sale time.
Q1412_C7	LOL, totally see where you LOL, totally see where you are coming from.  BUT, the clincher for me is this...........       Auto's are crap at Losail :)
Q1412_C8	Instead of a car loan take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car...  You can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like:-)
Q1412_C9	Xena, now that's what I Xena, now that's what I wanted clarification on.  I know I can't take a car loan as it would be secured against the car, which is difficult when I have to go out of country for it.  Sooooooo, it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car.  Might have to investigate this a bit further :)  Saeedkan, you'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way.  I thought there was only one way :)
Q1412_C10	AlanCarr at one stage I wanted to by a second hand car and the bank suggested that due to the interest rate being so high for second hand, about 12%, why not take a personal loan at 8/9% and pay for the car that way:-)  So yes, it can be done.
Q1412_C11	To be honest, I would do Rye  To be honest, I would do something similar, but my parents live in Dubai, so I'll just book it in for a service over there and go visit for the weekend.  Drive down will be fun too.  Xena, thanks for the info, all good to know.

Q1416	Where can women seek some legal advice? I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa. What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?

Q1416_C2	Thank you Thank you for the response.
Q1416_C3	rimlaw ...so what is the safest way of transaction? rimlaw ...so what is the safest way of transaction?  Since Cheques & Promissory notes are not enforceable.
Q1416_C4	Cheques and Promissory notes Cheques and Promissory notes are admissible in evidence for civil cases such as Collection Cases for sum of money, Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, etc. but not for ciminal prosecution of estafa or deceit.   While checks may have probative value to establish motive or intent it is not the quantum of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Promissory Notes on the other hand will disprove estafa since this document will clearly establish a loan transaction.  The safest way in transaction involving forebearance of money or exchange of goods for money is to have a contract or document that clearly specify the nature of transaction.  Never get swayed by sweet talking persons and you might end up scammed.

Q1416_C6	Intelligent... What is Estafa?
Q1416_C7	if Estafa is what MJ said, if Estafa is what MJ said, then what Human rights can do with that? Honestly, I think nobody can do anything about it, unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money. Even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed...  <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q1416_C8	You have 3 options. You may You have 3 options. You may lodged a complaint or blotter with any nearest police station. If he is a foreigner, the police will give him a visit together with your complaint. If the respondent will not own up, they can file your complaint with the prosecutors.  If the respondent is Qatari, you go to the Ministry of Human Rights and they will assist you there.  You may also try your embassy which normally have legal officers familiar with local criminal procedures to assist you.  Good Luck.
Q1416_C9	Qatar criminal and civil Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region. It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts.  For estafa or deceit, it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation, it will be filed with the Court of First Instance. You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer. But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit. If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience.  Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants. Cases involving foreigners, civil or criminal are handled by regular courts.
Q1416_C10	Evidence is very important Evidence is very important in criminal prosecution. Oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution.  The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken, your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan, and you have no case for estafa.  The essential element of estafa is "trust" and "exchange of goods or money". Prove this both and you have a case for estafa.
Q1416_C11	the formality or informality the formality or informality of your document is immaterial. What is material for your case to prosper in ourt is the substance of your document.   It must show the nature of your transaction, mentions the goods or money he received, his name and signature thereon, and any witnesses to the transaction.   If you parted goods or money based on his representations, and which you awfully trusted, and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back, and he reneged on this promise, then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa.
Q1416_C12	there you have it, your there you have it, your reference to the word "borrowed" presuppose the existence of a simple loan, and your allegations for estafa is doomed.  electronic mails or emails are now admissible in evidence in courts under certain qualifications. but what you have on hand is evidence of simple loan not estafa. in which case, if the amount involved is substantial, you are advised to seek a local lawyer to assist you in filing a simple case for sum of money and damages. Legal fees here are quite expensive, prepare with your deep wallet.
Q1416_C13	Ms J, promissory notes are Ms J, promissory notes are not evidence of estafa but of loan. Promissory notes are ancillary documents to the principal contracts of loan. If one cannot pay his loan, you do not sue him for estafa even if this is accompanied promissory notes and with rubber checks.   Issuance of bounching checks are not punishable as a crime in Qatar if that is what you have in mind.

Q1426_C1	RE: Is anyone using an electronic book reader (ex. Kindle... Both the wife and I use Kindles here in Doha.  The wireless obviously does not work, but you can download books to the PC easily and put them on the Kindle.  Books are way cheaper this way and a much better selection than any store in Doha.  I have no idea about Mac compatibility.  I suggest you check out Amazon.com and find out.
Q1426_C2	RE: Is anyone using an electronic book reader (ex. Kindle... Ditto what the first poster said.  I have the Kindle, friends have the Sony Reader, and both work fine here in Doha.  You just download to your computer and transfer over to the reader.   Since you can basically use an iPhone like an electronic reader (I have another friend who does that here), I suspect there should be no problem using them with either PC or Mac formats.  But check online to be sure.  Just my two cents: they are SO much better than books!!!  Cheaper to buy individual texts, much easier to travel with...  I got tired of waiting for a decent bookstore to come to this country.  It never will.  So cut out the middle man and just do it this way.  Only wish I had gotten mine sooner!
Q1426_C3	RE: Is anyone using an electronic book reader (ex. Kindle... I need to figure out how to download books and move them over manually.  Have any of you figured out how to do newspapers?  I'd love to get the international herald tribune back...

Q1437_C3	RE: about personal loans If you leave Qatar without paying your personal loan, definitely a case will be filed against you then you will be blacklisted in the immigration.  You should never visit Qatar again or else you'll land in the prison cell. Yes, personal loans are insured but bank can't recover it thru default or non payment. Insurance is for life only, meaning applicable only if the borrower died.

Q1437_C5	RE: about personal loans First of all such acts is non recommendable, by the way all banks are having very strong networks all over the world, they will trace the person out whereever he is, then u can imagine what they will do, and secondly within middle east they will black list the person and they will make the persons life miserable.
Q1437_C6	RE: about personal loans bank or any lending institutions extend such lending to you specially expats on the merit of your integrity thru your sponsor sometimes.  they granted loans even they do not know you 100% , and you should be thankful to such lending institutions.  the first thing you should do is to go to the bank and settle everything or else you will be facing many consequences in the event you run away from such responsibility.  there is a saying that says good karma begets good karma.bad karma will likewise begets bad karma.  think about this.

Q1460_C4	RE: where are  migrating birds staying Its a very genuine and interesting question.Please respond seriously,if some one knows. don take everything as fun.
Q1460_C5	RE: where are  migrating birds staying The reason birds migrate is that they are avoiding the cold weather brewing in the place they are staying so they move to warmer countries. There is a possibility they are just "passing through" Doha when you noticed them. Scientifically, birds can travel thousands of miles so it's possible Doha is not their final stop. They might have headed towards Iran or beyond... Once they know that the weather in their place has warmed up, they go back.
Q1460_C6	RE: where are  migrating birds staying I have heard , birds seen on Dubai Terminal , trying hard to caught up their Next flight , therefore , Security officers objected them lol , to proceed ,Guess what ,lol no transit Visa lol,
Q1460_C7	RE: where are  migrating birds staying JuliaRose, if u happen to look carefully, the birds are coming from Iran (the North Side) where the weather is more cold are going South to warmer / Tropical Climates. There are two types of Migration: long-distance migration, & short-distance migration. As per my knowledge, some short-distance migrating birds stay in warmer regions of Saudi Arabia along the red sea coast; whereas some more species travel to Egypt, Sudan and farther to Ethiopia. For long-distance migration, birds fly as far as South Africa too. More information can be found on WIKIPEDIA.

Q1464	Ticket vs Ticket Allowance An offer I got from a company in Qatar states that employee, spouse and 3 childern are entitled to annual vacation business class travel ticket allowance (market fare). When I asked the HR about that item, they said that employee will either get the business class ticket or an economy class allowance. To me what they have said doesn't go along with the offer. Any body has more infromation about rules in Qatar
Q1464_C1	As long as the BUSINESS CLASS travel ticket allowance is stipulated in your offer, black and white, then you are standing on a solid ground to claim it or to require such be stipulated too in your employment contract.   <a href="http://www.glitterfy.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://img10.glitterfy.com/graphics/35/Tinkerbell_Spoiled.gif" border="0"><br />Glitterfy.com - Glitter Graphics</a>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZutryIr1M
Q1464_C2	There is no rules in Qatar There is no rules in Qatar for the air ticket and stuffs. It will depend on the offer they provide to you. i mean what offer they mentioned in your labour contract. So as baldrick2dogs said, u can either cash out economy class fair or fly using a business class. simple !
Q1464_C3	I would suggest take the I would suggest take the Business Class travel offer much better..  ----------------- HE WHO DARES WINS
Q1464_C4	IATA fair is 50% more than IATA fair is 50%+ more than the normal fair, if my calculation is not wrong.
Q1464_C5	Its ver clear yv2r  Baldrick has replied very correct, if you want your company to issue a ticket, it will be Business class or if you want to encash the ticket money you will get only Economy fare.  All Airlines are approved by IATA, means International Air Transport Association, agents who have IATA approval will follow rules and regulations,there are many agents who dosent have this IATA,they give less price means, to survive in competitve market they share their comission what they get from IATA agent with the passenger.Dealing with approved IATA agent is always beter.

And no, im not yet in Qatar, im be there soon, thats why im asking for help, i wanted to buy a new camera there, specifically a Canon EOS 1D Mark III 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only).  Even when i know everyone says its more expensive there, any help is welcome!
Q1483_C9	Your decision Well photographer, the prices were mentioned in the earlier posts, now you make up your mind as to if you want to get it from outside or from here.
Q1483_C10	Top of the line Camera from Top of the line Camera from Canon is 1Ds MkIII - I think not available in Salam - The available camera is 1D MKIII (without "s") and it cost around QR20.  Or top ot the line from Nikon D3X (also not seen in Salam) - the available is D3 (without "X") with almost similar price with Canon 1D MkIII.  It's depend on your lens you have now - if you have Canon lens then you should buy Canon body.   I do not know what kind of journalist are you - sport journalist or indoor journalist. For sport definitely Nikon is the best, but for indoor Canon much better..  But why did you buy G10? it is not for journalist -- I use G10 only for travelling - for documentation / photography I use my DSLR..

Q1493	Notebook Hi Everybody,  I'm looking to purchase a Notebook(mini labtop). But i don't which brand is better. my Budget is around QR1,500. I need your advice which brand is more reliable and durable ( LG, Samsung, Dell, Acer) ??  Thx
Q1493_C1	Go for HP...best value for Go for HP...best value for money
Q1493_C2	Netbooks There are lots of online reviews of the netbooks you mention, most of which speak highly of the Samsung, Acer Aspire One and HP mini.  With these netbooks your personal preference of keyboard size, screen size, touchpad layout and battery life are more important than the processor speed, as they pretty much all use the same Atom processor now.  I recently bought the HP mini 2140 from LuLu Centre for QAR 1388, and I am very happy with it.  It costs between US$450 to $550 online, so it seems like a good buy.  Note that the LuLu one only has the 3 cell battery, which lasts around 2.5 hrs, vs the 6 cell battery with 5 hrs or more. The 6 cell battery can be purchased online for around QAR200 if you need to use it for long periods without a power socket.  A friend has three different netbooks and likes the Samsung best.  Unfortunately for him, it had a heat failure and has been returned for repair.  I also like the look of the Aspire One and the Toshiba, as they have slightly taller screens (1024x600 Vs 1024x576 on the HP), and square touchpad.  On the weekend I saw them at Jarir Bookstore (opposite Ramada) with 6 cell batteries for QAR1499.  I am thinking of getting one of these to try along side the 2140, but just can't really justify having two.  Most likely your decision will come down to which one you think looks best, after all, they're more of an accessory than a computer.  They also come in red, with flowers, so get the right one, or you will have to buy a new handbag and pair of shoes!  Jason

Its obvious the resellers dont want to push the lower priced ones as it gives them lower margin.  eg 10% on 2000 = 200 (which is at least something)    10% on 1000 = 100 (almost nothing)

Q1498	Been offered a job in Qatar.. Hi everyone!  I have been offered a job in Qatar but not really sure what to do as I think the salary is very low. It's 3000 riyals a month. Accommodation and transport are included in the employment package but I can't stop thinking about the salary for a full-time position. I also know that Qatar is a very expensive country.  What do you think?  Thanks in advance!
Q1498_C1	you think the offer is low? you think the offer is low? then forget it and look elsewhere.  But, If you don't have any higher offers yet, and has nothing to do with your time, why don't you give it a try.   ...listen to the sound of silence....
Q1498_C2	need more info whats the position, and what's your nationality.  pay is based on your race here.  3000 per month is a ridiculously low salary considering what the cost of living is.  you'd probably be living in a shack and be treated like dirt.  shameful people offer such low salaries in a country with the highest per capita in the world.
Q1498_C3	...what is the position, what is ur situation it depends on which position,, the questions in this forum is always  incomplete, and the guys wanted us the readers to guess and reply !!!!  if the job offer is for a Officeboy / Peon, the salary is good !!!!  if you have no job at hand and really in desperate mood, the salary is good !!!!

Q1499_C7	All,Thank you the All,  Thank you for the insightful responses.  I'm an operations Manager in the FMCG industry the U.S and have 5+ years of management experience in the fields of supply chain, logistics and warehouseing.  Are there any good recruiting agencies, which I can utilize to help guide my search? Contact information? Websites?  Thank you again for your help.
Q1499_C8	I don't mean to be I don't mean to be discouraging to you by any stretch but most people don't just up and relocate to Qatar. We are brought by specific companies for certain positions. That's why Westerners can be paid a considerable amount of money - they were recruited and hired from overseas because of a very particular set of skills/experience needed by a firm in Qatar. When our contracts are over we will, nay MUST, however sadly return to our home countries. It is not a free-market economy. There are some generic recruiting agencies but your best bet is directly with a company that needs your specialized skill or a headhunter acting on that company's behalf. If you haven't a skill that is in high demand (i.e. transplant surgeon) you will be competing for jobs with people from closer countries which traditionally tend to underbid their services. Mandi

Q1499_C10	It's tough Nisri, don't get discouraged.

Why do you think some passengers take their frustrations out on cabin crew, even though the cabin crew are trying to help them?   What would you do if you saw one of your colleagues being deliberately rude to a passenger?  If, for example, there are 60 children on the flight, but you only have 40 toys. How would you deal with this situation?

Q1501_C18	The  Truth of Interview If you are going to attend one of an open day with Qatar Airways, you should bear on your mind that the most important thing for them to accept you as a cabin crew is the shine on your eyes.  They do not expect from you to answer the all specific questions on a professional way.  They just want to know that whether you are able to be a cabin crew(Reaching 2.10 metres on your toes, no tattoo ) and want to work with Qatar Airways.  If you have the ability to impress people by your desire of being a cabin crew with Qatar Airways,then you are also able to impress the Human R. managers at the interview.   Good Luck!

You can start with direct purchase with the developers at porto arabia, Bahriyah, and other specific areas where expats are allowed freehold/leasehold properties. You can also look at the secondary market to buy properties already purchased.  Criteria - you need to have the funds to purchase and abide with their terms and conditions in the sale agreement.

Q1509	Lost/Replacement QDC Card Hi all,  It seems I have lost my QDC card. Or it was nicked from my car and some lucky guy is burning up my monthly limit. At any rate I need to get a new card. Does anyone know the policy on lost/replacement cards? Do I just pay a fee and get a new one issued? Or do I have to jump through all the hoops again and pay the 1000 riyals?  I am going down there on Saturday with my passport and a bucket full of hope. Advice appreciated.

Q1510	QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? What do you think about the QNB notes?? Is it a good idea for investment?
Q1510_C1	RE: QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? Dont know, whats a QNB note?
Q1510_C2	RE: QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? QNB Note is an investment product where the Capital is Guaranteed - so at the end of the investment period you are at least guaranteed your initial investment. The investment is linked to the performance of the Qatar Stock Exchange over the next 2 years. Obviously nobody knows how the stock market will do but I am pretty confident that over the next 2 years the investment should do better than the return on a Fixed Deposit inshallah! So if you have an investment strategy that involves equities then this product has got little downside - principal guaranteed so if all else fails - its just the opportunity cost on the money for 2 years - versus the upside of the Qatar Stock Market. Dont need to be an Einstein to figure this one out....
Q1510_C3	RE: QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? You should be able to do the same by following these two simple steps,   1. Take 75% of the total amount you want to put into this scheme into a high yielding fixed deposit scheme with any major like CBQ.   2. The remaining 25%,invest in equities yourself.   If the markets do well, you will make much more than you will with the notes, if the markets fare very badly, you will still have earned interest on the fixed deposit to offset the 25% loss on your equity investment portfolio.   Rgds,   J.J
Q1510_C4	RE: QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? my two bits are,,that min. investment is Qar. 20 k for a tenor of  2 years. if u put 20 k  in bank, u get max. 6% per annum..  I think, that in two years. QE will give u at least return of 6% p.a keeping in view, the QE at around 7300 nowadyas..  The worst scenario is that u will get your 20 k back after 2 years..  HAving invested directly  in QE directly, i had burnt my hands. however, i still am in favour of QNB NOTE 1, due to its timings. As QE is still not gone too high.
Q1510_C5	RE: QNB Notes!!!! is it a good idea?? i am also interested in this .. and like to know more about it .. i am watching :) ..please update more

I wanted to know if a 1000 Qatari Riyal would be sufficient for me to survive there decently for 7 days? Considerate and honest answers will be highly appreciated Thank you Dr. G
Q1514_C1	RE: I am visiting Doha for 7 days You would need 1500 to cover decent food and travelling.
Q1514_C2	RE: I am visiting Doha for 7 days Look up the hotels in Doha. Most charge 1000 for one night!
Q1514_C3	RE: I am visiting Doha for 7 days guys....don't discourage him.Let him come and have a good time.He could find cheaper hotels for 150 riyals per night in some remote ares like national,souq area etc and have food decently with 75 riyals per day and 400 to 500 riyals for local shopping.site seeing and taxi rents will cost another 500 riyals.So all together QR.2500 approx.Its more than enough for a decent stay.

Q1515	Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries Hi All,  I am having Qatar Driving License,will this license will be valid in all GCC countries?  If I get a job in UAE, this Qatar Driving license will be valid in UAE, or again I want to apply for driving license.
Q1515_C1	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries Yes it is valid in all GCC countries.  once you get the UAE residency you go to the UAE traffic department with the original Qatari licence and copy too,  you pay 100 Dirhams and get the UAE driving licence
Q1515_C2	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries If you are getting a job in any other GCC country then it means you'll need to apply for a valid local DL in that country.  If you are going to any GCC on a "Tourist" base then yes it is valid.  Regards!!
Q1515_C3	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries I know that you can use a Qatari Driving License supported by your Qatari RP to rent a car in the UAE, but if you leave here to work there would imagine you need to do a test for the UAE, unless your home license can be automatically transferred.  Should also imagine that once your RP is cancelled your Qatari license irrespective of date on it would also be cancelled.
Q1515_C4	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries your Qatar DL is valid in Qatar & can be converted to Omani license,Bahrain,Kuwait but not uae. u need give test in uae.if you fail u need to take classes opening file and keep trying your luck. getting UAE License is not so easy as u get in Qatar. u need good luck and if not u shed lot money in attempts. overall ur Qatari license is not valid to get uae DL. U Need to go through above process.
Q1515_C5	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries I got my driver's licence in Saudi Arabia and when I transfered here in Qatar, it was still valid for 2 months. I was able to convert it to Qatar driver's licence because Saudi and Qatar are part of GCC. I just don't know if this is also applicable if you go out of Qatar and convert it to UAE driver's license when you work there. But I have a strong feeling that it can be done since UAE is also part of GCC.
Q1515_C6	RE: Qatar Driving License will be valid in all GCC Countries i am from uae ,having valid uae license ,i confirm no Other GCC or Asian DL can be directly converted to UAE DL. apply for a road test if u pass ur lucky.if u fail u need to take minimum 5 class. then try till u succeeded.

Q1518	Buying from Ebay, NewEgg or TigerDirect, is it safe and shipment length and costs? Hey Qlers. I was wondering if i buy stuff from either Ebay, Amazon, NewEgg or TigerDirect, do i 100% get the item or do some people scam me?  And how much time does it take to ship it to Doha, and how much are the shipping charges?  Say i buy something used from Ebay, how can i ask it to ship it here as it doesn't give an option for Qatar.
Q1518_C1	RE: Buying from Ebay, NewEgg or TigerDirect, is it safe... I buy from all three places plus mwave.com, zipzoomfly.com and amazon.com. I use bongo us mail forwarding as they consolidate shipments. With aramex, each parcel is shipped separately and there is a minimum charge. So if you buy a memory card that weighs next to nothing you pay $30 or so. I believe aramex then charges about $8 US per pound for heavier parcels. Bongo consolidates - gathers all your parcels and weighs them as if they were one. They ship all your parcels as one shipment. You will save hundreds of dollars over a year of shipments. I have gotten shipments that I have paid only $6 a pound for and saved on consolidation.  Check them out they are fantastic.  http://www.bongous.com/parcel_forwarding.php  Aramex should wake up and provide consolidation services. DHL is also laughable as they do not consolidate. Fedex is never going to do that as they make too much on commercial shipments.
Q1518_C2	RE: Buying from Ebay, NewEgg or TigerDirect, is it safe... hey, i know that www.qbay.com (the ebay site for qatar) will be available but I don't know when. Someone was telling me that it will be very safe because you need to enter your qatar mobile number into the site and then varify your identity with an sms code. Clever stuff ?? it will keep the scammers away im sure
Q1518_C3	RE: Buying from Ebay, NewEgg or TigerDirect, is it safe... Thanks for the answers guys. Just wanted to confirm that Aramex is safe...
Q1518_C4	RE: Buying from Ebay, NewEgg or TigerDirect, is it safe... I am a permanant ebay shopper. I would advise you to always check the feedback of the seller. Don't buy if the seller's positive feedback is lower than 99%.

Q1527	Kuwait travel by road Hi all,  I have plan to go to Kuwait city with my own car. I got confirmation from one of hotel in Kuwait that they can arrange visa for me. Does any body know the route to go to Kuwait? 2 years back I was travel to Bahrain also by road and I know Dammam and I believe if I want to go to Kuwait I have to pass by Dammam right?  Thanks.

Q1527_C5	RE: Kuwait travel by road Hi Momo - I asked Kuwait embassy staff here and they told me that I must get the visa before enter to border land eventhough my RP title is mohandis. If travel by plane is ok I can get the visa on arrival but for travel by road little different. But it's ok now since hotel can arrange the visa.  Hi Remy - There is no special requirement. The Movenpick Hotel Kuwait just give me the form and I need to fill-up and sent it back to them and pay the fee using credit card (8 KD/passport). After I get the Kuwait visa then I need to apply KSA transit visa. Once we get KSA transit visa then halas we can travel to Kuwait by road.

Q1540	What is there to do during Ramadan? Hello, I just moved from the US to Doha yesterday and since it's Ramadan I don't know what to do! I hear that all restaurants/stores/etc. are closed... What's there to do for fun/shopping/eating during the day?  THANK YOU!
Q1540_C1	RE: What is there to do during Ramadan? All those sound quite boring... :/
Q1540_C2	RE: What is there to do during Ramadan? Well, it's a tough time to arrive, that's for sure!  There are western-oriented places that can be visited during the day, but you'll have to remember that there is no eating, drinking, smoking or gum-chewing allowed while out during the day.  That said, here are a few places I know that are open at least for a little while, each day and then also in the evenings. Carrefour - 9 a.m. - 1 a.m. Sat-Thurs - Villagio & City Center MegaMart- 8:30 a.m. - 1 a.m. Sat-Thurs - Landmark, The Centre Just about all the malls are open from 10 a.m. to around 1 or 2 and then re-open around 8 in the evening, so you can get a few hours of shopping in during the day and then go back at night if you run out of time. I understand the Iftar buffets are marevelous and served at most hotels.  That would be your late evening meal, and well worth the wait from what I'm told (I've only been here since late July, so I haven't had a chance to do all the Ramadan things offered yet)  Find a reliable taxi driver, and you'll be all set to pop around to the various malls to get better acclimated to the area.  Once the heat eases off in a couple months, it would be easier to get around by getting a drop off at a central location and then walking around the city a bit.  Get a Marhaba at a bookstore if you don't already have one; it is THE best resource for all this kind of stuff!  Have fun!

Q1542	Business Idea I've been thinking of setting up a business that provides a service for expatriates, but not sure what sort of service is in short supply.Does anyone have a suggestion?
Q1542_C1	I have to VBProgrammer I have to decide on a service or a product before conducting a feasibility study.  As for the capital, I have 2 options. 100,000 that I can invest anywhere (the problem is that it's too small), the other option is 1 million but this amount belongs to a company that is under establishment for educational services. So in this case any project must be in the educational sector. (to which we already have a business plan, but it's pending as we originally projected a capital of 5 million not only 1).  Perhaps you'll suggest that we switch to another non-educational project. That might be Plan B if we couldn't attract more investors.  wizz14: I'm both an investor and looking for investors/partners.

Q1548	Short Term Accomodation Hi  We are coming to Doha end of December and looking for a short term accomodation on monthly basis until we find long term villa. We need to be close to the Education City. Do you know of any?
Q1548_C1	Never tell conartists Never tell conartists (housing agents) your budget for a Villa! They will show you something worth 10,000 QAR and tell you it's worth 15,000! Check online for aparthotels which rent out apartments on weekly / monthly basis. And another thing - it is illegal for agents to charge you sometimes as much as a months' comission for showing you Villas. They get their commission from the landlord but many still try and 'con' the prospective tenant. Just a bit of advise - good luck!

Q1558_C5	It is one of the most It is one of the most popular unleavened flat-breads in Indian cuisine and is made by pan frying whole-wheat flour on a tava.[2] The paratha dough usually contains ghee or cooking oil which is also layered on the freshly prepared paratha.[3] Parathas are usually stuffed with vegetables, such as boiled potatoes, radishes or cauliflower and/or paneer (South Asian cheese). A paratha (especially a stuffed one) can be eaten simply with a blob of butter spread on top but it is best served with pickles and yoghurt, or thick spicy curries of meat and vegetables. Some people prefer to roll up the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea, often dipping the paratha into the tea....  BTW.....Omlet stuffed Paratha square in shape....available in Bombay.

Q1559	Car key with a chip ? Can I get a second one made ? Hi All  I've a Nissan Pathfinder and I need a second key made, but the regular key shops can only make keys that unlock the doors but not start the car. The Nissan dealer charges around Qr 300 to make a second key.  Is there any other place where I can get a second key made for lesser that can be used to start the vehicle ?  Thanks a lot for looking and answering.
Q1559_C1	RE: Car key with a chip ? Can I get a second one made ? Bro,  Try Industrial Area Street No 1 called Salam Keys( by the petrol pump besides mannai ). They make computerised keys , they can make a key which will start the engine.  Cheers,

I went to a shop in industrial area petrol station ( street number 2 ) opposite mercedes .   I was told by the person there that he have the same machones like the agency and I would have saved if I came to him first ,,,   try there .
Q1559_C6	RE: Car key with a chip ? Can I get a second one made ? Your key is purposely made to have a code for security reasons. It would be better to have it ordered to a Nissan dealer, and not somewhere else.  But if you dont mind having ur key code known by others, you can get a cheaper service somewhere else.

Q1561_C1	Long way It will take u like 2 hours.  U have to take the North Road or the one to Golf club first, then drive doha to Dukhan.  Depends on the hours you may will get some traffic.  Are you planning to do this every day or just one weekend??? if its everyday move from Al Khor.  There is no problem for female drivers, I believe you drive better than any of those bus drivers or pick up drivers...  The Venezuelan Sensation!!!
Q1561_C2	Boring and long drive Its a very long drive...Whew! thinking of it makes me feel lazy and sleepy! The road going to dukhan is under construction so you should be extra cautious on driving specially at night.becoz there are some areas w/o lights.

Q1561_C4	Its just an hour drive to Dukhan from Doha! Those who said it takes 2 hrs to get to Dukhan from Doha were wrong. However, the drive itself is boring.

Q1565_C6	RE: Dual SIM mobile phones in Qatar I will speak for the Samsung SHG D880. The following is from its user manual guide: ---------------------------------------------------- SIM card switching  Your phone supports the Dual SIM cards mode, enabling you to use two SIM cards at the same time without changing them.  Activate SIM cards and select the primary SIM card.  1. In the idle mode, press the swithching button at the left side of the phone.  2. Scroll to the SIM card you want to use and select Enable or Primary.  3. Press {Options} and select Save.    If you change the primary SIM card, the phone automatically turns off and back on.  ** You can use Browser, E-mail, multimedia messages, and STK Applications services only with the primary SIM card. ----------------------------------------------------  As far as I'm concerned with my phone, it doesn't need restarting since the sim from my country is only used to receive SMS messages and not for calls. That works for me just fine.  You can always go to the store bringing with you one Qtel and one Vodafone sim cards and you can try it for yourself before you decide to buy.

Q1575_C28	It's not a problem to do that. As Stone Cold and Carlos both said, leave the country, get married there, fly back in with your marriage certificate and it's not a problem. As long as she is married when she starts to show and (of course) when she gives birth, the authorities here aren't going to count backwards to determine the moment of conception and whether you were married then.

Q1576_C15	guys: They go all in packs to guys: They go all in packs to awkward places like That stinky coffee shop opposite to Ramada. They talk about their cars and about their connections in Qatar.. Just like Italians talk in the US about their families..When they see ANY girl moving, their eyes pop out, their tongues drop on the floor and they eye-rape the poor girl until she disappears.  Girls: They sit down and just text. they would be on a table with celebrities but they have their phones out and they just go at it as if iphone or blackberry are brad pit's testicles at his prime. When Guys talk to them, they mostly give that nasty look, even if they do like it deep down. They have to give the impression that they are not desperate.    Those who are "Cool" go out to the fabulous night life in Doha. W, which is ok.   Seven, is where Lebs compete on who looks the most like Antonio Banderas in Desperado. They are all Bad Boys. They walk as if their mothers were bred by dragons and not regular men. They are still stuck in 1993 when it comes to their fashion, their Jelly hair, Levis501 jeans and dare to tell them it is time for a change. British guys, mostly fat ones, have 4 drinks and they start picking up fights with our good old Egyptian friends or any other inferior nationality (inferior because of the work-visa system here)   Girls' main mission at clubs is "GET Drinks FOR FREE", they could be sitting with any degenerate that has money. They are fully aware of the male-female ratio that works to their advantage, and they act accordingly. If you want to pick up ladies, you GOTTA go out. Does not matter what you look like, Just dress nice, talk outta your bum and pretend you own everything and you will get to change the oil.   Another way to spend time, is to just Eat and sleep. You will end up looking like a para-shout in 2 years, lose some hair, and become a heavy smoker who's breath and farts smell very similar.     I hope this helps.    It sucks but i am starting to get in the game.

Q1577_C4	If you are coming from Al Saad, go travel going to City Center, The Prosecutors Office is in the same road of the back of City Center BUT on the other side.  So you can take a U-turn at the corner of City Center and turn right on the first street (after making the u-turn).  From the corner, approximately 200 meter. actually you won't miss it since it is the only building with iron metal  barricades and the parking within the area is full.  Your landmark will be, the Islamic Bank at one corner of the building itself.

Q1585_C45	You want them jailed and You want them jailed and deported?  How do you guys dealt with prostitutes in your home country....I wonder where you deport them? Middle East, Africa, Europe? :O  Seriously, I dont condone prostitution. But we all know that prostitutions in all forms are in every corner of this world. As long as the word "GREEDY" do exist in the dictionary, there's nothing we can do about it. Two people get jailed and deported soon, but 10 people replaced them from different countries and so on.   IMO,if they dont really bothers me in my own home at time of my rest, then I should leave them alone(exeption of criminals,of course). The authorities knows very well what's going on in this country and surely they're doing their best to dealt w/ them. Our job is to do our tasks at work and get paid for that but not to poke our nose to other people's lives.

Q1585_C47	A reminder for myself! :-) Copy pasted story:  A man was on his death bed, Someone asked him to give some wise counsel before he departed the world and he Said:  "When I was young I wanted to change the world and solve its problems, As I got older I realized that perhaps I should lower my sights, I thought I would be better served in changing my country. As time went on I realized that people of my country could not be changed.  I decided to change the people of my town , but they also did not wish to change, When I reached my old age I thought I would try changing my Family, here also I found my endeavors go to waste, try as I might my family members would not change.  "Now that I am on my death bed, I have realized that if I had sought to improve myself, and removed my own defects, then perhaps my family members would have been influenced.  Then seeing the behavior of my family people of my town would have been influenced. By seeing the spiritual change and improvement of the people of my town, the people of my country would have been influenced. And perhaps through the people of my country the world may have been influenced."  *Source Unknown*

Q1585_C57	Randomguy yes i have a Randomguy yes i have a thought about your thought too. The laws of Qatar is very strange as compared to other places, we all know that. Here you can get away with murder and get prison time for running a street light.   What is the definition of crime? An act of breaking the law. Yes there sometimes is need to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not, here the crime is not being committed by the ladies alone, its the men that pay for their services as well. There are crimes that hurt others and here they seem to not mind selling their bodies and having a "blast" just coz they are getting gifts and having an easy life, so what?   Keep in mind prostitution is the oldest "profession", so if they have no problem in providing this service to better their life then I dont think anyone has the right to question their motives or morals.

They too are committing a crime and they too must know that it's wrong and illegal in this country.  Personally, I don't really care what people get up to, it's no concern of mine.  I think Holland has the right idea - make it completely open and legal.

Wow!, I can;t believe i was going to be spotted with this douche?
Q1585_C108	LIS I don't know FriedUnicorn, but I doubt he is jealous of not being with a disease ridden prostitute.  Plus that is just a lazy response that a 5 year old gives when you question them, or take affront to a particular action "you're just jealous that it is not you".  Really? So people cannot be disgusted and outraged by something without being jealous. Okay.... Weak argument, and avoids giving a solution.

Q1585_C123	street cornered In my company, most of the women are bankrolled by a Qatari. Nice cars, nice phone, given some pocket money (hush money), and have to be available when the guy slides up in his Land Cruiser and wants some extra marital loving.  Is this prostitution? The line is blurred, right? They would say they are in a loving relationship...and they live, drive and eat beyond their means. It is why they came to the country, to snare a rich Qatari. If you report these women, they'll just deny and say it is their boyfriend, and that the money is a 'gift'.

Q1585_C127	FrU Hey I know, I am not condoning it.  It is why my company has tightened up the Visiting Rules (although they will deny it, and say it was just for 'our safety'); a constant stream of men entering the accommodations to visit particular women.  I don't know if CID would bother. If these people are advertising then it is a problem, if they are discreet then the country probably doesn't even care. Which is a contradiction, obviously.

Q1585_C132	Don't they prostitutes marry Don't they prostitutes marry the guy first and then get divorced as soon as the deed is done?    Besides, so long as they are here of their own free will and getting a decent wage they are performing a valuable service to this predominately male society.  The UAE is full of them.  At least they seem to be more discrete here.

Q1597	is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant women? my best friend suspects that she is pregnant. at the same time she has fever. is it okay if she will take vitamin c or panadol?
Q1597_C1	RE: is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant... Panadol is considered safe during pregnancy. Vitamin C won't do anything for a cold, so it's best not to take when you might not know what else is in it.
Q1597_C2	RE: is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant... Just consult with doctor.
Q1597_C3	RE: is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant... panadol yes...vit c...yes. BUT, it is always recommended to consult a doc or at least the pharmacist.

Q1598	How is the salary range for a better life in Qatar My husband got an offer from a Qatar Construction company with a salary of 2500 QAR + Accomodation. Please let me know it is a good offer or not. Also, is the family status possible with this salary and what is the minimum salary for family status?
Q1598_C1	RE: How is the salary range for a better life in Qatar What is his job & position he received this offer then we can comment. But still you ask about the family living in Qatar I will tell you some facts. As per the present rule your salary should be more than 7000 QR. then only you can apply for family visa.   If you want to hire a single bedroom appartment in Qatar you have to pay minimum 5000 QR. Living expenses for a bachelor will be minimum 700/800 QR. per month (I think), then family you can imagine. Qatar is very expensive. Before going to accept any offer from here please re-think twice. Is that suitable for you? Or consult with any friends or relatives living in Qatar. All the best.
Q1598_C2	RE: How is the salary range for a better life in Qatar family not possible.\ accept or reject offer as per ur financial condition and job designation. for labour salary is around 800 qr along accomodation. Average salary for sacretary is around 4000 qr. therefore, think and decide as per ur condition. normal skilled person can get easily more then 7000 qr.

Q1599	Background checks on teachers / staff etc I am just wondering if anyone knows how teachers and school staff are checked out in Doha? If a school follows the british curriculum does that mean they woild carry out similar background and criminal checks etc? I will obviously ask the schools this but wanted to get everyones view. Thanks V
Q1599_C1	Well that's certainly NOT Well that's certainly NOT true at the Universities. All degrees are checked and a cpmplete background and security check is done (not just a police certificate.) It is very thorough and should be. Mandi
Q1599_C2	This is actually massively This is actually massively worrying that they are not doing background/police checks!! I mean... its REALLY worrying, not knowing what sort of person is teaching your child. I mean you see it often in the UK, teachers who have been arrested on child pornography charges, and this is WITH the police checking!!
Q1599_C3	My partner did comment on My partner did comment on how 'trusting' the nursery appeared compared to the UK where a newly employed person cant be left with kids without being supervised by existing staff for several months.   Best thing to do is ask the place what they do and visit it to get a feel.
Q1599_C4	Vikwa No,  Teachers over here are taken purely on CV and interview. There are no police checks done in most cases.  Most schools say they do checks but as Qatar has no juridisction, how can they?  As I say, they don't do checks and neither do they check qualifications (that's in certain schools).  Anybody that can prove otherwise, feel free.

Q1601_C1	RE: mozaic tv The Internet connection which comes with Mozaic TV is fairly good and relatively continuous. The speed vary all the time depending upon the use of Internet of the other customers. Anyway, it is the best you can get for this amount. The quality of TV programs is worse than what you can have with a simple digital receiver (costs about 120 QR and 0 QR per month).

Q1607_C3	Please judge based on evidence or personal experience It's that time of the year when new comers to Qatar begin exploring schools for their children.  Good luck with it all.  It is not an easy process.  But I think it would be more helpful if people spoke from personal experience and based on evidence.  Impressions and second hand information can be misleading. BTW, my kids go to Sherborne, and I am pleased with it.  I don't think it will be comparable to the Dorset school.  It can't be, and I don't judge it on that basis.  I judge it on the curriculum, staff, activities, interaction with parents, etc.  As for fees, while it is not cheap, it is less expensive than Compass, ASD, and ACS Doha.  I think DESS is subsidized, right?  Good luck with ACS and when you've gone through the experience, please write about it.  I am sure many people will want to know.
Q1607_C4	DohaExplorer--do you know <p>DohaExplorer--do you know much about Sherborne's association with the boarding school in England? &nbsp;Is the campus in Doha essentially a branch or is it just licensing the name?</p>
Q1607_C5	Dintovich...what do you mean Dintovich...what do you mean about "being honest"? I have nothing to hide whatsoever. And we are very happy with the school my children go to, I have no reason to consider change. But, if I were, then "rich kids" would certainly not be a deterrent for me. Although, except for  some Qatari children, i have not seen any rich kids here.
Q1607_C6	you are right kiwinyc. it you are right kiwinyc. it seems like Dintovitch does have a very large chip indeed which makes me suspicious about how genuine the comments are. perhaps the fees are too high for them, or their kids did not get in when they applied or they are they elsewhere and are worried about some of these new up and coming schools taking away students. might go and have a look at sherborne myself so there is your answer Dintovitch, my children are not at sherborne but i have heard many good things about it. now answer expatlady.
Q1607_C7	In a court of law the judge In a court of law the judge does not examine the motives of why a witness says this or that but looks at what has been said; is it or could it be true or false?  If we start on the road of why somebody says something or another we will end up nowhere. I could for example retort by asking why, you out there, are you trying to protect Sherborne-Qatar and I could go into theorizing about you perhaps being British and want to protect your national school or your kids are in that school and you want to justify your decision for taking them there or many large number of possible motives. If we go along this road there will be no end to the discussion.  Let us instead try to be rational and confine ourselves to facts and not to what is in the hearts and cannot be seen. It doesn't really matter whether I have a chip on my shoulder or not (you will never find out), what matters is; what I have said about Sherborne-Qatar, is it or could it be true or false? This is what we should look at. Also, when I say "spoilt rich kids" I don't mean they are spoilt because they are rich per se, no, those unfortunate kids are the kind that have been brought up mostly not by their parents but by the maids (not even trained nannies) who are in the palaces. And regarding this point the same will apply to ACS Doha.  Another point needs clearing; I did not say that Sherborne-Qatar is bad as teaching goes (but it could be bad for your kid because of the demographics.) I said that it will never be like Sherborne-UK because the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is different from that for Sherborne-UK. Sherborne-Qatar has shareholders who will siphon money away from it unlike Sherborne-UK.   Please also remember that Sherborne-UK is only a secondary boarding school which means Sherborne is new in the primary school field. Why did they start with primary school in Qatar? Is it because it is a bigger market?
Q1607_C8	Sherborne Prep in Dorset was Sherborne Prep in Dorset was established in 1858 for students from aged 3 - 13 years - therefore I think they have some primary school experience. It runs alongside Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls Senior Schools. They also have an international school in the UK which prepares overseas students for entry into their main schools. The schools are both day and boarding. There is a clear understanding and acceptance that Sherborne Qatar wishes to establish its own identity whilst keeping some of the values from the 'mother school.
Q1607_C9	If you google "Sherborne Prep If you google "Sherborne Prep in Dorset" you will find that it has nothing to do with the 560 years old Sherbone-UK. It just has the name Sherborne by virtue of being in Sherborne town. If you visit Sherborne-UK website you will find that the only link they have is Sherborne-Qatar. Also the schools' logos are different.  As for the International School that prepares overseas students for entry into the main Sherborne, I know nothing about and I don't know whether it even exists. If it does I am sure it is totally separate from the main Sherborne that we know. It could be a private school that has thought of exploiting the niche of preparing students to the main Sherborne.  So, I stand by what I said earlier that they have not managed a primary or a prep school before! I am not saying this makes then inadiquate, no, I don't know about that, but just that they were willing to undergo such an experience for the sake of financially supporting Sherborne-UK.  You will get just as good an education, if not better for your kids somewhere else, cheaper and without being hit by the demographics I mentioned earlier.
Q1607_C10	Wow.  I didn't realize. Wow.  I didn't realize.  Thanks for the post Dintovitch.
Q1607_C11	Not only that it will never Not only that it will never be the same as Sherborne in the UK because of the spoilt rich kids but also because here in Qatar Sherborne is for profit unlike its sister in the UK because a)they have a Qatari partner to whom they should pay dividends and b)part of the extra money they make goes to support the true Sherborne in the UK which is facing some financial difficulties; why do you think they are here in the first place!?   You are right AngelinaBallerina, Sherbornr-Qatar can never be as Sherborne-UK.     All in all I think Sherborne-Qatar will mar the name and the old academic tradition of Sherborne-UK.
Q1607_C12	Dintovich, I have children in Dintovich, I have children in school here. I have not seen many "spoilt, rich kids" that mar the reputation of our school.....what kind of people are you actually talking about???
Q1607_C13	Whatever next 'Oxford Whatever next 'Oxford University Qatar'?? Shrewsbury School Qatar?? Marlborough College Qatar......Nahhhh....
Q1607_C14	Look, all I @ nomerci  Look, all I am saying is that the raison d'etre for Sherborne-Qatar is not the same as that for Sherborne-UK for which you have taken your child in the first place. Sherborne-Qatar was originally founded in order to provide dividends for its founders and shareholders; the Qatari plus Shareborne-UK. Really there are better and cheaper schools with less pompous names such as DESS that was founded just for the benefit of the students who study in it and no one else. But unfortunately many prefer to brag about their kid who is studying at Sherborne-Qatar.
Q1607_C15	Hey nomerci, where were your Hey nomerci, where were your children before you took them to Sherborne-Qatar?
Q1607_C16	Dinovitch, ok, I have no idea Dinovitch, ok, I have no idea about that school, so I take your word for it. Although, I know of a few parents and students who seem to like the school.
Q1607_C17	Thank you nomerci for being Thank you nomerci for being honest! Good luck to your children wherever they are but don't take them there!
Q1607_C18	Where do your children go to Where do your children go to school Dintovitch
Q1607_C19	They are well-established in They are well-established in the UK - you can see their website here http://www.acs-schools.com/acs-doha.aspx  I have toured the campus and have to say it's quite impressive.  My son is at Compass, which I am quite happy with, but you won't go wrong with ACS-Doha either.  Here's some info from their website:  The Programme  Initially we will be offering our prestigious Early Years, Lower School, and Middle School curriculums, based on globally recognised American and international standards, with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programmes successfully offered at our three UK campuses [learn more]. As the campus develops a High School we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious US College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses. ACS Doha will also offer an American High School Honours Diploma. The school will shortly be a member of the Council of International Schools.  The Doha campus offers a rigorous academic curriculum of English, mathematics, science, humanities, world languages, and fine arts. Our programme challenges students to become independent, reflective, inquiring, and knowledgeable; confident communicators who are principled, open-minded and caring; socially and emotionally intelligent and able to embrace the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Q1607_C20	Be careful, it is one where Be careful, it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate. Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers.  There are still many good schools where your child will much happier. Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above!
Q1607_C21	well my children are not well my children are not spoilt, dont have bad manners, havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich - neither are their friends of which they have many. For you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter I am trying to picture your children, if you have any of course. If parents bring up their children well enough, they will not be affected so much by negative peer pressure whatever school they are in.
Q1607_C22	Where are Hello d-esertmum  Where are your kids? How can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools? And if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high. ACS Doha has not started yet anyway, so do your kids go to Sherborne? Hope to hear from you because I disagree that kids don't learn much from their peers; peer pressure is a strong force!
Q1607_C23	sorry i prefer not enter into sorry i prefer not enter into such arguments. you are entitled to your opinion and I likewise. I am just saying my peace. i hope you are happy with where your kids are at school. i am and thats all that matters to me.
Q1607_C24	We are only trying to help We are only trying to help someone decide on a matter that will affect the future of her children. If you say things along those lines then I think you should substantiate it. You responded to my first comment as though I didn't know what I was talking about and when I responded back, you said you didn't want to discuss the matter! I think this is unfair! Why did you challenge my opinion in the first place?!
Q1607_C25	Help someone? Really? Bye Help someone? Really? Bye Dintovitch!

Q1610	Dog walking on the Corniche? Can anyone please help?  I adopted a pup from Qaws on friday after the big fire and took him down the Corniche last night with my family for a lovely walk. We could not see any signs not to walk the dog but somehow felt out of place doing it!   Can someone please tell me if it is okay to walk dogs there as I do not want to offend anyone.  Many thanks,
Q1610_C1	Thanks for your comments so Thanks for your comments so far guys. Just to let you know I always clean up after him and he does not bark at anyone. I would not trust any dog to be let off the lead... well not over here anyway so he will always be by my side :-)  I enjoy a walk down the Corniche and wanted my new dog to enjoy the same.
Q1610_C2	someonenew I beg to difer.. i have seen some real dogs at the corniche..  Ruffffffffffffffff!
Q1610_C3	:) Brit. That's probabaly :) Brit. That's probabaly true but as far as I know dogs are not allowed in the Corniche, parks and other public places in Qatar. Most people who have dogs in Qatar walk them on isolated beaches and empty spaces near their houses. Please ask Xena/Chelsea/QAWS people about this. Dont get into trouble by walking them at places where they are not allowed.  "Ali Baba and 40 thieves" are now "Ali Baba and 30 thieves" ; 10 were laid off.
Q1610_C4	Not allowed Its unfortunate but dogs are not allowed on the corniche and even other small parks in neighborhoods. Its not a dog friendly country! Also be careful if you are by a beach and you let a dog off leash chances are someone in a car will get close to it and steal it happened to friends of mine.
Q1610_C5	How sad... ... that we are not allowed to walk dogs on the Corniche. What harm can that do? Another minus point for this country, to add to many others already.
Q1610_C6	I agree with you Alumnar, I agree with you Alumnar, not a lot you can do!
Q1610_C7	just pretend as if the dog just pretend as if the dog is walking you and no one will have any problem!  I don't think Corniche is off limits to dogs, but make sure the dog is with a leash..
Q1610_C8	LOL Kwan!!! I just LOVE the idea that the dog is walking you!!! I would love to be there if somebody walking a dog is approached and told off and uses that as a response... I bet that will take a while to sink in! Thank you for the good laugh!
Q1610_C9	I don't know about signs, I don't know about signs, but I have seen a couple of people walking their dogs there ..  just remember not to leave any doo-doo behind :)
Q1610_C10	No problem mate, just be No problem mate, just be sure your dog is not barking or he will not bite someone.  <a href="http://www.danasoft.com"><img src="http://www.danasoft.com/sig/381129.jpg" border="0"></a><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:11px;">  <img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/15xppg9.jpg">
Q1610_C11	Barking is instinct since u have just adopted the pup,as jaredboy sugested of no barking/biting, teach the pup of not barking/biting in public places,avoid walking late evenings as lot of kids walking freely of all nationalities,so that some cranky parents object.
Q1610_C12	I think the corniche is off I think the corniche is off limits to dogs.  "Ali Baba and 40 thieves" are now "Ali Baba and 30 thieves" ; 10 were laid off.
Q1610_C13	NOT ALLOWED!! Nothing is more relaxing than flying like an Eagle in Heaven !!  It s not allowed. not allowed to take ur pets to the cornishe, not allowed to fish there, not allowed to swim there, not allowed to ride bicycle. and if the police catch u doin any, i think the fine is 600 QR. am sure bekoz we took the puppy with us when i was with my friend and the police stop us and ask us to take the dog away. honestly we didnt know that its not allowed and he explained to us the above mentioned.
Q1610_C14	a question ! I moved to a house in ALnasr st., but my neighbor is having a place besides my window, He uses this place for chicken, and house birds which makes a very bad smell, and dirt, Is that acceptable by law?  A H M E D  F A T H E Y
Q1610_C15	I was just down there I was just down there yesterday. It seems as though there are certain areas with a sign that says no dogs and other areas that don't. I'm not sure if this means it applies to all areas of the corniche or just the ones that explicitly say so. Then again the police are the ones enforcing it and they may be ignorant as well.
Q1610_C16	Don't bother You will be stopped eventually. It won't be the Arabs that stop you, it is the Indians that hates dogs.  They seem them as dirty; which is shocking as most Indians don't wash their hands and spit in the street.
Q1610_C17	WHO LET THE DOGS WHO LET THE DOGS OUT???????????????????  please tell me when you'll be at corniche with your dog so i reschedule   sincerely  cynophobic  Yalla!

Q1623_C2	RE: Female sharing rented flat with male? IT IS ILLEGAL  SHARIA LAW  http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/03/24/10027928.html  The Sharia: How it affects you   By Bassma Al Jandaly, Staff Reporter Published: November 02, 2007, 01:19    You could be sharing an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex. And the arrangement could be innocent, purely for financial reasons. But in the eyes of Sharia law you are committing an offence.   More and more people are being punished because they claim they were unaware of the law and its clauses.   There are hundreds of cases such as these that emerge each year either from the police or the courts. An increasing number of men and women, who are not blood relatives nor legally married, and have shared a flat, room or even sat in tinted cars, are being jailed and deported, a lawyer said. These men and women have shared no relationship.   Dr Adel Khamis Al Mimari from Al Itazan Consultant and Advocates said they are being punished in accordance with Sharia law. The clause is known as "Tawajed" or "Tahseen Al Ma'asiya". These couples have been punished under this clause: sharing a closed place and encouraging sin even though they shared no relationship.   He told Gulf News: "The bottom line is awareness. Many foreigners are not familiar with Sharia law and hence they are punished. If these couples go unnoticed, then there is no trouble. But if the authorities for some reason or another know they are sharing a ?closed space' they can be punished. This is the law."   All about respect   "These couples believe they are leading a normal life, like they would in their home countries. But this is considered a sin here. Filipino nationals top the list of nationalities who fall into this trap followed by Indians, Europeans and Chinese. People should be educated about this issue to avoid problems."   Dr Ahmad Al Qubaisi, a leading Islamic scholar, told Gulf News that every nation has its culture and traditions. Each nation should respect others.   "Westerners respect each other and they know their countries' traditions and laws. So why when it comes to Muslims they claim that they do not know anything about the traditions and culture? The West knows well that Muslims, like Hindus, Christians and Jews, have their culture and traditions. They should respect our religion," Dr Al Qubaisi said.   The tradition   "Our tradition is against a man and woman, who are not legally related, mingling privately or being in a closed place alone, while in the West they can have a sexual relationship even though they are not married. Our traditions are very different," Dr Al Qubaisi said.   "We see many such cases of foreign men and women in courts. They say they do not know the traditions and religion here. They should know and respect our tradition the same way we respect their tradition and religion," he said.   The sentence   Dr Khalifa Rashid Al Sha'ali, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Ajman University, said if a man and a woman who are not related are caught alone in a private place, they face a jail sentence or lashes even if they were not involved in any suspicious act.   It is up to the judge's discretion to decide whether they should be deported.   Dr Al Sha'ali, a former Ajman Police Chief, told Gulf News that during his tenure, he dealt with several such cases.   Mohammad Yousuf, Deputy Director of the Dubai Courts Department, said while the Federal punitive law is implemented in the UAE, the situation is different in Dubai. The Tawajed or Tahseen Al Ma'asiya clause, he said, is not implemented in Dubai.   Sultan Khalifa Bin Bakheet Al Matroushi, Chairman of the Ajman Federal Appeal Court, said if a man and woman are sitting alone in the work place or in front of people, they will not be charged. If they are found in a bedroom or in a house or car and the circumstances are suspicious, they will face charges even if they have not committed adultery. The couple can also be deported, he said.   Justice minister explains the law   Mohammad Bin Nakhira Al Daheri, Minister of Justice, told Gulf News that according to Sharia, if a man and woman are found in a closed place alone they may get arrested, but he gave an assurance that they are held for good reason. He stressed that the police would investigate first.   "If a couple is found alone in a closed place such as a house, room or car they may face legal action. There also must be a complaint against them. However, if their actions are not against public morals such as being in their work place or inside a lift, of course no action would be taken. If police receive a tip that a man and woman are in a closed place, they will investigate and if they are not doing anything against the law they will not be punished.   "There must be a complaint and investigation from police. The public prosecution and the judge can decide if something illegal was going on," Al Daheri said.   What the people say   Kristina from Macedonia has been living in the UAE for the last six months. She said she has no idea about Sharia law or the clause, which prohibits men and women, who are not blood relatives nor legally married, from sharing a flat, room or even sitting in tinted cars.   "People must have privacy. It is strange that a neighbour or a watchman can call the police if two people are in a private place alone. Why don't people call the police when they hear someone beating up his wife at home?   "Many of us here are not Muslims. We respect Islam and the traditions of this land. Hence, our way of life should also be respected."   She said it is the responsibility of companies who hire people from abroad to make them aware about Sharia.   "This law does not exist in my country, where it is normal to be with your boyfriend alone in a closed place. I think if companies alert people before they come here, it will help them."   Mohammad Elias from India is in his 20s and not married. He has been in the UAE for two months, but says he has never heard about the clause.   "I may not agree with the clause, but I do respect the law of the land here, and I think foreigners should adhere to the law," he said.   Tess Yema from the Philippines works as a teacher in a school in Sharjah and has been here since August. "I am aware of the law. I have a brother-in-law who has been in the UAE for many years. He told me about the clause.   "Before coming to the UAE, the authorities in my country told me about Sharia. I knew these aspects very well before coming here. I respect the law in this country and I respect their way of thinking even if it is different from the one in my country," Yema said. "I was even told about the dress code here. I knew that if I offended the law I would face punishment," she said.   Samer Assaf is married with two daughters. His family is in Syria.   "I have been living here for more than 15 years, but I have never heard about this clause, not in my country and not here. I am a Christian, but I respect the traditions and customs of others."   Lucia Alinea from the Philippines, has been in the UAE for a few months only, but she is well aware of the clause. "My brother has been here for many years and he is aware of the Sharia law. "I tried to learn as much about the customs and traditions here before leaving the Philippines. We have to respect the law here or anywhere," said Lucia, who is a teacher in a private school in Sharjah.

Q1623_C8	RE: Female sharing rented flat with male? a lot of western couples live together and don't seem to be bothered by the law, however it is playing russian roulette to try, when at any time u can be arrested.  see attached story from gulf times today:  Kissing lands couple in trouble  By Nour Abuzant A MARRIED couple was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for kissing in public and conducting an illicit relationship. The Muslim woman and her Christian husband, both from Lebanon, skipped the country before the trial concluded after being told the State did not recognise their marriage, which took place in Cyprus. Despite their inter-faith union not being an issue in their home country, Doha authorities ruled it unlawful  even though the woman was apparently given a residence visa based on the sponsorship of her husband. The couple landed in trouble after a Qatari family called the police to complain they were kissing on the Corniche in April. The police officer who attended the call said he found the two in an indecent position and when he confronted them, the woman screamed that they were married. The officer insisted that their marital status bore no relevance to the offence. During interrogation, the arrested man, 27, claimed he had done nothing more than place his hand on the shoulder of his 24-year-old wife who had arrived in Qatar 10 days earlier. She told the public prosecution that she did not realise that such an act was illegal in Qatar. It was during their trial that the tricky subject of the pairs marriage came up for debate. The couple presented their marriage certificate to the court. However, it was ruled to be invalid in Qatar. The court admitted that a residence visa had been issued based on the fact that the two were husband and wife, but the country had the right to cancel that at any time if information came to light requiring such action. The court also admitted there was no evidence of malicious intent to hide the couples differing religions and that their documents were authentic. However, the court made it clear that Qatar could not accept the marriage within the constraints of its own laws. The couples lawyer said there would be no appeal lodged against the verdict as his clients had left the country after a travel ban had been lifted.
Q1623_C9	RE: Female sharing rented flat with male? What's the confusion? It is illegal. Are you asking if people break the law? There may be those who do, and there may be those who get away with it for a period of time. Is it a good idea? Not really. You don't want to be embroiled in a legal system with which you are not familiar.
Q1623_C10	RE: Female sharing rented flat with male? "An increasing number of men and women, who are not blood relatives nor legally married, and have shared a flat, room or even sat in tinted cars, are being jailed and deported"    sad but true, if you don't want to end up in jail or be deported...  better share your room or your  accommodation with same sex...  we are expats, we should respect the law no matter how cruel it is

When taking the first exit to the left, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal left and approach in the left-hand lane keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left to leave  When taking an exit to the right or going full circle, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal right and approach in the right-hand lane keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want  When taking any intermediate exit, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise select the appropriate lane on approach to the roundabout  you should not normally need to signal on approach stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want  When there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a roundabout, use the most appropriate lane on approach and through it. 187  In all cases watch out for and give plenty of room to pedestrians who may be crossing the approach and exit roads traffic crossing in front of you on the roundabout, especially vehicles intending to leave by the next exit traffic which may be straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly motorcyclists cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and signal right if they intend to continue round the roundabout. Allow them to do so long vehicles (including those towing trailers). These might have to take a different course or straddle lanes either approaching or on the roundabout because of their length. Watch out for their signals 188  Mini-roundabouts. Approach these in the same way as normal roundabouts. All vehicles MUST pass round the central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable of doing so. Remember, there is less space to manoeuvre and less time to signal. Avoid making U-turns at mini-roundabouts. Beware of others doing this.  [Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 & TSRGD regs 10(1) & 16(1)] 189  At double mini-roundabouts treat each roundabout separately and give way to traffic from the right. 190  Multiple roundabouts. At some complex junctions, there may be a series of mini-roundabouts at each intersection. Treat each mini-roundabout separately and follow the normal rules.
Q1637_C6	RE: how to drive on round-abouts? Get out early Morning and do a few practise rounds following the above lane disciplines To add a few more tips Once you build on your confidence - never keep up with the car next to you on either sides - pay extra attention to Land Cruisers/Karwas and domestic help drivers - dont react to flashing lights and constant honking, when they pass you by, show them your palm with a smile and then touch your palm to you heart, like saying pls forgive, trust me their whole face changes
Q1637_C7	RE: how to drive on round-abouts? DRIVE IN YOUR WON WISH,CONCENTRATE ON ALL 4 SIDE CARS AROUND YOU, THAT IS THE BEST WAY, MOSTLY ARABIC DOES IT.
Q1637_C8	RE: how to drive on round-abouts? with extreme caution
Q1637_C9	RE: how to drive on round-abouts? I enrolled in Al Khebra and this is what they taught me:  Left Turning: Stay on LEFT LANE. 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down. Check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about. If there are vehicles passing you just stop. If none then go to the inner lane of round about. Make sure your signal is left. As you pass the center of straight exit, signal right. Check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to left exit on the left lane or middle lane.  U Turning: Stay on LEFT LANE. 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down. Check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about. If there are vehicles passing you just stop. If none then go to the inner lane of round about. Make sure your signal is left. As you pass the center of left exit, signal right. Check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to u turn exit on the left lane or middle lane.  Straight: Stay on MIDDLE LANE (if 3 lanes) or RIGHT LANE (if 2 lanes). As you approach the round about slow down and check the left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about. If free then go and stay on the middle or right lane of round about. As you pass the center of right exit, signal right. Check your right mirror for safety while you go in the straight exit. Stay on the middle lane or right lane as you go in.  Right Turning: Stay on RIGHT LANE. Signal your right and as you approach the round about slow down to check for cars on your left that are already in the round about. If free then go and turn right.  REMEMBER: 1. The cars coming from the left side of the round about is the priority meaning you have to stop and give them way. 2. Always use your signals so that other cars will know where you will be exiting. 3. Not all drivers know the proper use of signals, lanes and priorities in the round about so BE CAREFUL. Drive defensively.  I don't have a picture to show you but I hope you understand those instructions above. Just picture the round about as a +                   | Straight Exit                 |                  |  Left Exit ----------- Right Exit                 |                 |                 | Where you are coming from  Hope this helps.

Q1650	Alcohol Is it possible to bring alcohol into Qatar? Don,t want to be deported as soon as I arrive!
Q1650_C1	Why would you want to bring? You can buy as much as you like here...Only need to wait for your RP and the Liquor Permit from QDC. Even if you don't have those,you can always find people who can help you in procuring :)  You just need to wait for the ramadan to get over though...:)   Source:  - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I (September,1999)

Q1651	I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 I am getting mis cals from +224 55201665 and other numbers but when i tried to call no reply can any body tell me is it any scam call or what? any one else facing this problem??? what to do kindly help me...
Q1651_C1	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 actually to day i got same miss call from same type of number .but it's a different number like +22355686969. but i know it's from my country bangladesh. because that time i call my country than i understand .some time all number not coming...and some time all number coming but before come +22 like ....so it's not to worry....
Q1651_C2	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 The only thing i can tell you is that someone from Guinea is miss-calling you... As far as I know there are multiple case where someone miss-calls and you call back and then your phone load is gone or you get charged a lot if you have a subscription.  But as far as i know, now there are security measures in place to prevent this from happening. But that doesn't mean that they do not happen anyway :)  Just be careful and don't call back. Send an email to Qtel or Vodafone and tell them about your problem. Normally they should be able to help (block the phone number from calling again).  I'm not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone...

Q1651_C5	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 it is a scam...I have had calls from +224, + 239, +370...best advice is that if you dont recognise the number, don't answer the call and don't call back or text...
Q1651_C6	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 Are you crazy to call back an unknown number? Do you know someone to call from that country code? Have you heard about sim cloning?  If they want to talk to you they will call again. It could be a trap. There are lots of mafia who are doing cloning of sim cards and using it for illegal purposes. If you call back your sim could get cloned and will be used by them for illegal activities which could lead you to great trouble. If you are getting missed calls from unknow numbers just ignore it for being safe.
Q1651_C7	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 That's a PHONE CALL SCAM from American state of Illinois or  from the country of Guinea.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_codes_847_and_224  http://countrycode.org/guinea
Q1651_C8	RE: I am getting miss cals from +224 55201665 I heard that when you call to those mobile numbers all your data saved in the phone can access to the other party...its another scam method..So dont call back them...    "If you are important for somebody the call will come gain...Dont go behind ugly dog who doesn't care about you"

Q1652_C1	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC hi  approach the legal authorities and present this case to them. show your bank account details to prove that you dont have job and is not paid for 1 or two  months etc. be submissive to your boss and its your need to get this offer. convince her on your situation and inability to continue here even if the job is on as your boss say. I do belive that once she is convince that you have no other way and will leave her, she will agree for it. Her main issue may be that if you leave with NOC others will also come in line for that.  manoj
Q1652_C2	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC Take her out for a drink and speak your soul out to her, I am sure she is going to say a yes and remain your friend forever and never a boss
Q1652_C3	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC Mr. Manoj,  there can't b harm if i approach for legal action... i mean they can cancel me.  plz tell me how to n to whom i have to approach
Q1652_C4	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC DO what Meet12345 said.. thats a best solution.. else you have to file a case, that salary is not according to your qualification and experience.. and get the release by court.. our accountant did same thing with his previous company.(2nd option) but try your best to get release from her in proper way.. convince her. count a million problems. or else demand a big salary. and in mean while try for another country.. may be you get good chance out side qatar.. life is not only in Qatar..

Try to be more active and strong with her as she have no reasons to keep u doing the same every month for nothing just show that you r angry and may contact the labor department. for more info u can call me any time 77513154. most of sponsors need no issues with labor ministry so you can count on it as she can't pay u
Q1652_C6	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC since you are telling your present company is not having job, so convince him to release you and provide NOC
Q1652_C7	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC Its a common problem, try to handle and manage your boss. otherwise no way to get NOC.
Q1652_C8	RE: How to convince my boss for providing NOC It purely depends upon your relationship.  Buy some sweets and try to meet her after office hours if possible. As you both chickas so i guess meeting outside is not so tough.  And show her you offer and discuss your future plan with her like you will get married, you have problems in your family, you need to be more financially secured to help them etc.   I did the same to leave my previous employer. My Boss was so impressed that he gave me NOC and he gave me his own money too. Of course I dont wanted money from his pocket but my story was so emotional.  I guess you got the point.

Q1653_C6	RE: Early Learning hai          2 years is too early to start formal learning..at the same time no need to neglect learning session completely....you can use building blocks to make her familiar with the concept of numbers... spend quality time with the kid and thus she learns names of objects with out being burdened... read  lots of stories  so that she becomes familar  with books  and her imagination works and books automatically  become her friends when she grow up....Formal learning can wait till she is 3....Enjoy your time with her because kids grow up fast...
Q1653_C7	RE: Early Learning kids are learning all the time, talk to your child all the time. talking and reading fun books with your child will give them a good start.   baby einstein videos are great you can watch some of the dvds on youtube  link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQY71epI14Q&feature=related  You can also view lots of learnig materials on ABC's, learning colours, nursery rythmes etc on youtube.  link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtFXYvNIxws  Bear in mind while these videos are good for kids to watch and learn, dont replace them with reading, drawing with crayons, puzzles, blocks etc.   also be invloved and play with your child, they will learn whilst they are having fun with you.

Q1660	where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator spray here? I am so upset about little creatures, they keep on coming back even if i keep my room clean. But my suspect was this other room which is I think a factory of bed bugs. I want to eliminate these creatures before any serious infections happen.  But I don't know where can i find the pest pesticides for this problem, please guide me....
Q1660_C1	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... the best and it really works!! is at carrefour is called SPRING' anty bladluis' is a green can. is for gardening but was the only one to kill my bed bugs and is cheap! and safe for beds.=) please try it. is in the gardening section
Q1660_C2	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... The best thing to kill bed bugs is actually FREE - UV light! take your mattress outside for a few hours. don't forget to turn it regularly.
Q1660_C3	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... They are the worst creatures/bugs on planet earth. Its so difficult to exterminate them. What ever pesticide you will use most probably they will show up again. What ever the pesticide. The only thing I believe can work is that take all your wooden furniture out in hot sunny day including your bed and leave it there for couple of hours. Killing them by burning them is the only good solution. Pesticide can work but you will never get 100% results. I once saw a documentary on national geographic and I am telling you its really hard to get rid of them. If you think they are coming from the next room then my recommendation to move out.  If I have to pay 10K for one room I will instead living in a room which is free but full of bugs. Good Luck exterminating bugs.  Peace.
Q1660_C4	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... You can try Carrefour saw some thing there. But like Balderick2dogs suggested UV light is best will get rid of most of these bugs..
Q1660_C5	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... Hi friends, Those nasty bed bugs are not only living on the bed. They live on the curtains, furnitures and even under carpet. If you leave them untouched for some time they will increase in number. UV light is good for killing them from your bed but you cannot take everything to sun light. It will be better if you treat all the materials in your room at the same time. Take your bed to the balcony or terrace and leave it there for two three days in the hot sun light turning it upside down very often. You may use the pesticide (the one from Carrefour) in your room for one or two days. Spray well and keep the room closed. You should use it vigorously. This will kill the bed bugs in your room as well as on your bed. Make sure that your friends in the other room should also do it at the same time otherwise you will not be able to clear them.
Q1660_C6	RE: where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator... UV light!

We made a civil marriage (not in the church) in our country. Is this going to made any problems for us with getting a visa and working in Qatar?  Thank you all for your answers.

This is going to be a difficult decision, since I don't consider converting to Islam as an easy option.

Q1676_C13	pisces_girl_1985... What about living together? You don't have any issues with that? Since it is considered illegal.
Q1676_C14	its not considered illegal as its not considered illegal as long as u have a marriage certificate attested from the embassy of the respective countries. They didnt even ask us abt our religion !
Q1676_C15	Better advise I never heard any religion saying that if you LOVE someone, and because of you are JUST DIVIDED BY FAITH, loving him/her will give you one way ticket to HELL.  Religion usually refers and teaches fairness, respect, truth, humility.  So NO DISCRIMINATION of faith in marrying as per as I know.  I have several friends married Muslim to a Non-Muslim, either way but the teachings of goodness manifest on how they apply towards other people and work, and not towards on what they are believing religion.  Anyway, OPINION is a really opinion... There is no right nor wrong.  And we cannot further discuss if the basis is Holy Quoran and Holy Bible.  We cannot justify arguments from different basis. They have both their own strong points, deal with it.   If the marriage documents are attested by the both consul, then I think there is no problem and big deal at all.  This is just a discussion forum, don't use this as your actual reference. The best thing is to inquire your cases to Qatar Government Agency directly, you are not the only one who have this kind of problem anyway, I'm very sure there is always fair ruling that you can get from them. Good luck!
Q1676_C16	"Anyway, OPINION is a really "Anyway, OPINION is a really opinion... There is no right nor wrong."  But the marriage in Islam is NOT a matter for anyone to give an opinion over...  It's a fixed law. It's forbidden... So it's WRONG.. any "true" muslim wouldn't even dare to cross that line... but I assure you whoever did it.. they're muslims by name.. and I don't think they care to pray or fast...  If they fear God.. they wouldn't have done it...
Q1676_C17	Reem_Q6R... very well said!
Q1676_C18	is she still muslim
Q1676_C19	Okay, so I guess getting a Okay, so I guess getting a working visa for us would not be a problem since there are two different sponsors.  But the fact that we would be doing something illegal concerns me. We would most definitely be living together and that should be considered illegal because of our muslim-christian marriage.  And on top of that, we could not get a housing from sponsor because our marriage is considered faulty.
Q1676_C20	deleted sorry, misunderstood Op post
Q1676_C21	I know of a family whose I know of a family whose family visa was rejected on the grounds that the marriage certificate(attested by the embassy) was not valid/legal. The wife was Muslim and the husband Christian.   Since you have been offered jobs by different sponsors visa might not be the problem. But I assume  you will be living together so please look into the fact that your marriage will be considered legal/not.
Q1676_C22	There be no problem in There be no problem in getting visa because you'll be working w/ different sponsors. You will only face problems when caught living together and/or if you change your wife's sponsorship under you. Because Islamically you are not legally married and Qatar is an Islamic country.
Q1676_C23	But would the employer (if But would the employer (if housing is provided) know that he is not Muslim (whether housing is provided by either employer)?
Q1676_C24	Troll alert Mega troll alert.  Bepsy gave you away...
Q1676_C25	I don't think your marriage I don't think your marriage will be considered valid here. There was a story some time back about a couple who were deported after some public display of affection issues on the Cornish.   When the case went to court turned out that their marriage was considered invalid and they both ended up being deported.
Q1676_C26	saeedkhan you wasted your breath on bebsy and bob corn Troll
Q1676_C27	marycatherine.. My hubby is a convert and he had to have legal documents attesting his conversion,along with our marriage certificate, as he hasn't changed his name legally. Thus he has to prove he is a Muslim when applying for family status. So the sponsor will find out the OP's not a Muslim unless he has documents to prove he is a convert.
Q1676_C28	from different sponsors....so from different sponsors....so no problem....
Q1676_C29	Not at all, even without Landing in Qatar you learnt about bepsi thats amazing. Good luck troll
Q1677	buying S VOLVO car hi friends i am intending to buy a second handed volvo car of S80,2004 within my range but worried about the maintenance and other expenses which may rise in future that would drain out my pocket.can anyone  share their experience of using the same car and also your opinions about that car of second handed type.
Q1677_C1	RE: buying S VOLVO car Never think about it, maintinance cost is very high and the resell value is very low.
Q1677_C2	RE: buying S VOLVO car Ask previous Volvo owners. If you ask the vast majority of Qatar Living members that will drive nothing but Japanese cars then you won't get an honest answer.   Also please do remember that you are buying a prestige brand so the cost of maintaining that will be more than a cheap, volume brand. When it comes to customer service at Volvo service centres, please just try them once. They are professional, courteous and most of all honest.   If you would like any information or history on the car you are buying please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476. I work for DOMASCO Volvo and we DO VALUE ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS!
Q1677_C3	RE: buying S VOLVO car I've been using Volvos for about 5 years now both in Qatar and in the UK and they have proven to be very reliable cars. The cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for.  Regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years, I think that person was talking about American cars.
Q1677_C4	RE: buying S VOLVO car I agree with Joe90. The S80 a great car. Here in North America both Volvo and Honda are considered great cars (and Toyota) that offer great value and great service from dealers. It's disappointing to hear the dealers of these cars n Qatar doesn't hold up their end of the bargain.  You'd hardly need to worry about a Volvo breaking down. When it does, yes, parts are a bit more expensive than Japanese cars but nowhere near the level of Mercedes or BMW. It's comfortable and safe, huge trunk, sporty feel. You could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start driving it, which is why it uses as much gas as it does. I love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when I move to Doha.  So, that's why relatively, I see less Hondas on sale on this site than Toyotas. The dealership. I was wondering why I don't see the Honda Ridgeline and Pilot listed anywhere, nor the Toyota Sienna. Honda's mystery solved.
Q1678	Qn for all Moms - Frequent Fever My Kid is falling sick frequently for the past 3 months.Whwnever I go to the doctor I receive the same answer "VIRAL FEVER" and nothing to worry about.  Is it common for the kids here or should I get her diagnoised (take her back home) completely.  BTW, My kid is 3 years old.
Q1678_C1	Oh blocked noses are very Oh blocked noses are very common in children this age!! There is a medical reason for this but I'm not sure enough what it is to post....... Don't put your child through the stress of bloods and xrays for nothing...its extremely traumatic for them!
Q1678_C2	Thanks Ranishkt and Seema.. Thanks Ranishkt and Seema,Thatz so assuring.She is "somewhat" okay after she left the Day care.  DoraTheExplorer ..A big thanks to you.I was really worried about her blocked nose thing.She was not getting proper sleep too for the last 3 months when I left her at the day care.And sometimes she used to bring back her water bottle full.Can u imagine she was not drinking water also.I saw that twice and then removed her from that day care immdly.Now she is with my maid.By god's grace she is doing okay.Still keeping my fingers crossed.There were days when I used to check her forehead continuosly for any fever(I know itz crazy but I was just going mad).   I am now becoming bolder after a lot of assurance/inputs from all.Thanks to all.
Q1678_C3	einstind, you're einstind, you're welcome.....hope she's better now.....theres alot to be said for sleep in children this age, thats why it bothers me when I see young children up at ridiculous o'clock, they need sleep and rest to boost their immune system. When they don't get enough they fall ill with all and sundry!...
Q1678_C4	hi You go for urine routine and culture test evn doctor say no. This will help you. My son had similar problem and doctor was keep on saying ear infection, Viral infection and so on. We did urine test and found UTI. Proper treatment was done according to the requirement.
Q1678_C5	antibiotics for a viral infection? I am not a heatlh care provider, but I recommend you change the doctor. If it is a viral infection, there will be no need for antibiotics. why is he/she giving her antibiotics????????? and 3 antibiotics in 3 months???? oh come on! And why not a blood test???? Go to another doctor..
Q1678_C6	get another doctor's get another doctor's opinion.. just to be sure, have your child undergo a general physical as well as complete blood workup even X-ray.. no harm in doing that, this is your child's health at stake.. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"><img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/Misc/Smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gif" title="MySpace Comments" border="0"></a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingchees
Q1678_C7	Thanks MJ.. The link is very informative..
Q1678_C8	There is no such Hi einstind There is no such a thing as Viral Fever, because  1.If its viral there is no fever in the body. 2. If there is fever it means there is infection somewhere and the natural body defense is trying to fight it by increasing the body temp.  The fact she is in daycare that means exposed to many new things to her system teach her always to wash her hands. 3 years old are very smart and can remember rules :)   This is what I personally do when my kid doesnt feel well: 1. No medication (NO Antibiotic)  2. Keep checking the temp. Every 1/2 hr. 2. Take him to my chiropractor for spinal adjustment (Dr. Cyrus is our chiropractor here in Doha) that will help the child's natural immunity system. 3. Chicken soup with lots of onion and garlic. 4. No sweets or fried food. 5. Let her eat plain yogurt it helps to reduce the inner body temp. 6. Light clothes and keep washing her feet with cold water.  Hope this will help
Q1678_C9	Seastar.. Thanks a lot for the information.Could you please let me know what does a chirpractor do?I mean his role...Anyway will google it also..
Q1678_C10	Can I ask u who is ur kid's Can I ask u who is ur kid's doc??!
Q1678_C11	My daughter's doctor is Dr My daughter's doctor is Dr Attiya at Al Ahli, we have also seen Dr Samer there as well. He is very good too. They might be a little on the expensive side, but very worth it as far as your child's health goes.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q1678_C12	I had the same Einstind,  I had the same problem with my daugter when she was in the DayCare but since your child is at home try starting with shampooing your sofa set and carpets and keep your house dust free.  Al rafa there is good doctor for children Dr.Basha or try Dr. Shaboon at Doha Clinic
Q1678_C13	Suzan, We go to PEC or to Dr Badsha of AL-rafa..
Q1678_C14	nqatar.. nqatar, Was ur daughter prescribed freq antibiotics?
Q1678_C15	If it was me, i would take If it was me, i would take the kid home. Can't trust the medical profession here!!! period.   ------------------------------------------ Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum sonatur.
Q1678_C16	i totaly agree with formatted soul Since we are here,my 3 years old daughter is always sick,she was never sick before,always having high fever,cough ,her doctor used to say its an allergy he was just changing the medecins and giving her antibiotics,so i decided to take her to another doctor when t told him what happend he decided to do a chest x ray and he found out that my daughter had atypical pneumonia!!! So you have nothing to loose by doing a chest x ray....by the way she got it from the nursery....good luck.
Q1678_C17	Also if it is a virus, they Also if it is a virus, they are not supposed to give you anything for it. You are supposed to let it run it's course. No antibiotics. I hate it when my daughter is sick...I feel so helpless. I hope your little one feels better soon. Be strong.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q1678_C18	Thanks MM... By God's grace she is okay now.Hoping that she will not fall sick again.But this is what I am going to do the next time she falls sick.I am going to insist the doctor for an X-ray and a blood work-up.Bcoz she is having blocked nose very frequently(not running nose).I suspect there is something beyond this normal cold and fever thing.
Q1678_C19	Get a humidifier or take her Get a humidifier or take her in the bathroom with you and run the shower on hot so it creates a lot of steam. That will help clear her nose. Another thing I use is Vicks Baby Vaporub. It has menthol and eucalyptus, and it opens their little noses pretty quick. I worry about the medical care standards here, but so far Dr's Attiya and Samer at Al Ahli have done a great job for my daughter and we have been here almost 2 years. Good luck, hope the little one stays well! : )  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q1678_C20	Its better to do a chest Its better to do a chest x-ray....ask  the doctor to  test for pneumonia...the doctors here dont really diagnose it at the initial stage...but it will be worse later. repeated fever is one of the symptoms....   <a href="http://photobucket.com/images/funny" target="_blank"><img src="http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/N-A-T-A-S-J-A/Funny/smile.gif" border="0" alt="smile Pictures, Images and Photos"/></a>
Q1678_C21	Common anywhere/everywhere The new name given by my family to this VI is School Syndrome, you shall notice that this occurs frequently when the schools open and continues. This SS goes away or stabilizes when the schools go for longer break (fortnight or more).  The issue is that we go to the doctors when the symptoms are acquired and he works with you to remove or stable it.   The area where no body works on is the prevention, both the parents and the school managements or even the health authorities. It is all left on herd immunity but does not affect much.  The parent should teach the kids basic hygienic plus give them fresh clothes every day and make them take shower every time they land in and also give them the natural preventive gifts (details can be provided on direct IM/PM)  The school should have better distances between each pupil (seating arrangement) and better ventilation arrangement in the class and or playground (if internal) and further monitor that no kids with flue or infection should attend the classes. Furthermore the transport should be much cleaner and well ventilated. The schools should also have records of the pupil who have pets at home specially the caged/feathered pets, to be sure of the possible sources should some viral infections arise from the pets,.  The Health authority should be the observers for both of the above actions on frequent basis. this can get really worrying if with this frequent hit of viral infection and following on use of Antibiotics, the children will get immune to the AB and then one have to use steroids which is not good at all.  This out of my experience should bring the so called 'school syndrome' to the least....  Hope this helps you as well.  Take Care
Q1678_C22	Thanks for the reply MM.. My Kid was in a daycare for the past 2 and a half months.She felt sick very frequently when she was in daycare.  But now she is at home with my maid.She was fine for last 15 days.But got fever again yesterday(doctor says "VIRAL" again).I am just worried if it cud be something serious.
Q1678_C23	Thanks FS and Abusaif.. Abusaif , Will keep it in mind.  FS, The doctor says no need of xray or blood test.He said there is no sign of pneumonia as well.I am just totally confused and to be frank frustrated.  As a mom I am not able to see her taking medicine frequently and in 3 months she has been given 3 antibiotics.And one started again yesterday..

Q1681	is it really cost effective to buy online? I hope people share their experience in online shopping. Which items are recommended for online shopping?  Also please give some examples of the total cost in both cases (online and in store)  Thanks
Q1681_C1	Open an Aramex/Amazon account It's the only way. If you choose the cheapest postage on Amazon it gets' better still.   Aramex of course charge for the postage but there is an option on Amazon to send all your orders together. I don't know if this works out cheaper or not. I just order at will and when it comes I pay the fee.
Q1681_C2	There are plenty of things to There are plenty of things to buy online that are a lot cheaper than buying in Qatar, here are some of the things that I have bought online:  Apple products - much cheaper  Sunglasses - Raybans; much cheaper  Mobile phone accessories  Asics Gel trainers - much cheaper  Books - Much better selection and cheaper.  Generally anything that I want to buy that is going to cost over QR500, I will check online to see how much I can get it for there. I get all the stuff sent to my aramex account and then sent to me here in Doha.
Q1681_C3	Never had any online Never had any online purchase, but would like to get some feedback.
Q1681_C4	Isobel In Amazon if you choose products which are sold and shipped by Amazon you have the option of shipping them as one package, or if you get some products which is being sold by amazon but sold by some other seller then it will be shipped from two places to your Aramex account.  Aramex unfortunately does not have the possibility to consolidate all your packages and ship as you want, hope they start it soon coz of their prices. But DHL Easyshop does it. I haven't used them till now, but if i do end up buying from different places then i would definitely use it.
Q1681_C5	it depends on the items check the prices online + tax + shipping rates then compare the items price sold in Qatar.  i bought DLSRs, lenses and camera accessories for me and my friends in amazon.com or adorama.com as it is much cheaper there with shipping rate and tax included

A neighbor's house was raided by cops last 4 months and captured a Pinay and Syrian living together unmarried..-both were still in the detention up to now..  Another couple has just terminated and deported recently by their company because of the same case..  ..people with the same case and were repatriated immediately  are still lucky--they were not tortured..   adams.apple,  these are just few of the many  cases I've witnessed,,people might not believe it as it may not be in the newspapers or any other means of media, but what I have highlighted above are based from what i have witnessed personally..  ..Got a clue, be an expert soon..

Q1690_C6	I did it Hello Kombizz and everyone,  I am Egyptian and I bought a 2 bedroom apartment but in the Pearl Qatar. I have got the loan from the bank and it wa smy very good choice to do so as prices started to raise again for rents and for purchaes. Although I felt at the begning that it was risky but now I am coformtable as I am paying the monthly instalment which is less than the rental offcourse for similar size and quality flat.  To answer your question, yes there areas where you can buy apartments and it can give a 99 years RP, regardless of your nationality.  Secondly, I advise anyone who has the downpayment, to go for purchase not rental specially if he is looking for quality life..  You can contact me for further advice
Q1690_C7	If you already have a work If you already have a work visa you wont get another RP.  My uncle in US owns a property in the Pearl and he got a RP here, but he cannot work with that RP.

Expats CAN buy property is designated areas i.e not only in The Pearl. Its true the cost of an apartment in the Pearl  is more than 1M.  But you dont necessarily be a millionaire to own one; banks do give mortgage if you are having a long term contract with very high Salary.

Q1695	problem i am working for a company since December 2008 ...can i change my job and my sponsor? and if he canceled my visa can i go out side qatar and come back to another company?
Q1695_C1	RE: problem salam  if you want change ur sponcer the only thing you can do is just canceld ur visa and be sure it's cancled then go out and come back  business visa you can do that only one  year after that you can come to new visa
Q1695_C2	RE: problem First you need a NOC letter, no matter what! Second, even though you worked less than 1 year with the same company it shouldn't be a problem to transfer the sponsorship from one company to another, ecpesially if your new Company is strong enough. Your nationality is the advantage in this case.
Q1695_C3	RE: problem If cancelled, a minimum of 2 year banned will be imposed to you, banning you to come back to Doha. Avoid cancelling your visa and try to convince your sponsor and have a nice conversation to them. be patient and humble always.
Q1695_C4	RE: problem mr ammar..guys don't mislead the person, if you don't kow what you are talking about. he CANNOT just cancel an RP and come back under the business visa...he won't be allowing into the country with NOC letter in the first place! All he needs is NOC letter.

Q1697	What is the best Steak Resturant in Qatar? I am bored of making home steak and the only steak house i have seen is the one in Villagio. Is there any other resturant where they serve good steak.  Has Meat Company opened up in Doha? Chillies, Benigans and Applebees are not an option for good steak.
Q1697_C1	RE: What is the best Steak Resturant in Qatar? my fav. is deep-fried steak from chillis.......
Q1697_C2	RE: What is the best Steak Resturant in Qatar? thanx guys. Fridays, chillies, pandarosa, bennigans all taste the same to me, not mouth watering steaks like Meat company in Dubai and Bahrain and Sizzlers Restaurant in Henry's Cafe Bar really good. i miss that place already.

But still, I don't think its dry aged.  I have had steak at the restaurant at the top of la cigale which was actually incredible.  Of course it was Wagyu beef and cost about 350 QR but it was comparable to the best steaks I've had from places like Peter Lugers, Delfrisco's, etc.

Q1706	are creepy crawlies everywhere? hi we are southafrican living in uk and soon to be moving to qatar. my hubby got offered a teaching job with villa accomodation provided. problem is i am completely irked out by creepy crawlies. i read on the forum about the roaches and other pests in qatar accomodation.  can anyone tell me if this problem is common in all accomodations, even more expensive ones and apartments?
Q1706_C1	thanks that is slightly more thanks that is slightly more comforting. i was horried to read about people having to lockdown toilet seats and gaps in the windows etc to keep them out so i wasnt sure if this is the general trend and something we should prepare ourselves for.i can imagine myself losing sleep over roaches running on my bed or getting stuck in my hair eeekk! i understand it is a warm country and a certain amount of tolerance required, not so sure i can accomodate pests in the home though. will have to wait and see.
Q1706_C2	If you have a villa such If you have a villa such problems would be minimal to nil in my experience.  In apartments, often the case is no matter how clean you are - your neighbours standards may not be up to yours and the bugs get in.  Again, not as if you were living like an unhygenic family, but the bugs know no boundaries.
Q1706_C3	Agree with Marycatherine Mel1 as a Saffer myself, I can guarantee you will see no more cockroaches crawling around your house here, than you would see back home:-)  Qatar is parktown prawn free;-P
Q1706_C4	well ..... i am at the company apartment at the mo ... i find i have to wash the floors everyday... because of the cockroaches.... my house is very clean but unfortunately its the maintenance of the building which is utter crap.... and then some neighbours also certain not clean.... i have been told its pretty normal ..though the cleaner you are the better off course ... i cant wait to move to the villa as i will have a bit more control ... dont despair.... though .... i hateeeeee them so muchhhhh its the worse freaking insect i can put with .... in the UK we had the spiders but heck i managed to get rid of the things here just seems doesnt matter what i do ... you see them every now and then coming from the outside ... ewwwww .....  its getting rarer and rarer but it doesnt make it any easier that we have construction site all around us ....  you will be fine ... :) dont worry ... its worth leaving london to come here .... we are portuguese and southafrican who also lived in the UK for many years :) good luck and enjoy the move :)
Q1706_C5	just bring 10 big lizards just bring 10 big lizards from UK then if you got a three rooms villa just put each room with two lizards and 1 in the kitchen, 1 in the sala and in the bathroom...
Q1706_C6	Mel1! a warm welcome to Mel1! a warm welcome to qatar. To be 100% sure you don't confront these stupid bugs, I suggest you to ensure that your villa is newly constructed, ie you are going to be the first occupant. Also ensure that it has been furnished with new furnitures and not the refurbished or that are shifted from somewhere where it was in use. If the furniture is new, the chances of bed bugs welcoming you will be minimal. During your tenure here, keep your kitchen oil free (difficult!) and maintain overall hygiene and you will be well off. All in all qatar is a small and beautiful country. Just make sure you don't introduce few new species in qatar. :)
Q1706_C7	I hate CCs they scare [Mod I hate CCs they scare shits outta me
Q1706_C8	Hello! Well pests do exist Hello! Well pests do exist everywhere and Qatar is no exception.The general standard of cleaniness is fairly good here and surely wont dissapoint.If you are goig to live in a compound then will be maintainance and cleaning as well.So no worries there.

Q1710	Can I sponsor 23 year old son for 6 months? My son just finished college and would like to come to Doha for 6 months and try and get some work experience.  Can we sponsor him? We are Uk citizens and Our income is sufficient. Can we do this and where do I go to get the form. I look forward to  your  feedback.
Q1710_C1	Definitely.  Ask your company's mandoob for the form or go to immigration in Gharaffa and there are people there who will type/prepare document for a very small fee. Initially they will give you a family visit visa good for one month and if you really want to extend for another five months, then he has to go for medial clearance within seven days upon arrival.  But still, approval of extension still depends upon the mood of the people in the immigration at the time of application! Good luck!
Q1710_C2	??? yes u can, "family visa" go direct in MOI fill a form and they will give u 3 months visa and you can extend upto 3 months...
Q1710_C3	will good luck, unless they will good luck, unless they change the law without me knowing anything about it...you can't sponser a son for six months family visa if he is over the age of 20...you can have him on a visit visa. goodluck
Q1710_C4	As far as I was aware you As far as I was aware you can't sponsor males over a certain age on a family visa. I believed the age was 18, but you could get special permission up to the age of 21.  Explain the situation to immigration - maybe they can give you an alternative way to get him here. Possibly an extended visit visa.
Q1710_C5	My son was 19 and i was told that he could not be sponsored by me.

Q1718	good doctor search!! heelllo! i am new in qatar, can anyone suggest a good pediatrician in the city preferably around hilal, bu hamour,mansoora!!i have the govt hospitals are not very relaible!! thankkss! happy new year everyone and have a healthy year ahead!!
Q1718_C1	sorry carol forgot to mention sorry carol forgot to mention dr kumar is located at this clinic called healthspring near doha modern indian school, around abu hamour!
Q1718_C2	Look if you have quite Carol,  Look if you have quite enough budget / insurance Check Dr. Attiya in Al Ahli Hospital,. You required to get appointment because this doctor have a long quee.  follow this link to get more info. http://www.ahlihospital.com/index.php/pediatrics/
Q1718_C3	Good pediatrician? Try looking at Al Ahli hospital. They got goood doctors. But I hope you have enough budget or an insurance card holder.
Q1718_C4	Hi carol, it appears from Hi carol, it appears from your post that you have not been to a govt hospital, then it's a bit presumptuous to state that govt hospitals are unreliable. It all depends upon the kind of treatment your looking for. There is a pediatrician in al shefa poly clinic in hilal area, who is good. I have also visited the doctor in Medcare centre, in hilal, but was not quite satisfied.  Take care.
Q1718_C5	Pedi... Forget about Al Ahli Hospital!!! They charge QR500 only for consultation and the doctors are useless!!! I live here 7years and have 3 kids raised in Qatar, and i promise you, Al Ahli is NOT the way to go.  There is a good doctor, a female right behind the Aramex office close to Decoration RB.  I think its family medical centre.  Then there is Future medical Centre opposite Villagio, i went there twice with my youngest, was ok, not Super keen with their treatment.   It depends why you need to see a doctor.  If your child just have a normal cold, Al SAAD medical Centre is Great! I dont have good experiance with any other gov. clinic, but can take my hat off for the Al SAAD branch! I know by experience and have many friends that will sware by them.  If your child just have a regular cough, due to the change in weather its likely due to an alergiec reaction to the dust in the air, they will prescribe you with antihestamine = Zyrtec and then a very good and herbal cough syrup = Prospan, these two are all you need every time you kid passed through a viral flu. welcome and good luck.  Hope my info help.
Q1718_C6	Yup charlepunt, go to a Yup charlepunt, go to a private clinic or to a health centre, if it's a viral infection or the seasonal flu, they will give you paracetamol, prospan, anti histamine and if the infection has been  there for some time, then they will add a antibiotic to it. So it all depends upon what kind of treatment you are seeking.  By al sadd medical centre, are you referring to the ped emergency centre?

Q1724_C4	RE: RIAL to PHILIPPINE PESO? There are quite a few currencies that the banks will not exchange at the moment. No doubt the number will increase as those countries economies move from inflation to deflation and then full blown depression.  With the crisis in Gaza the region is quite nervous add to that the global economic crisis, the banks are not in a panic but they are being ultra cautious. Also, the slow internet issue has sparked off a lot of conspiracy theories. But the coincidence of banks being careful, stopping currency exchange, the military build up 1,500 klms away from here, and communications being a problem is worth considering. Not all banks have reacted yet but my sources indicate:-  CURRENCY BUY / SELL  Bangladesh Taka 0.000000    Algerian Dinar 0.000000    Egyptian Pound 0.000000    Jordanian Dinar 0.000000    Lebanese Lira 0.000000    Srilankan Rupee 0.000000    Nepalese Rupee 0.000000    Philippine Peso 0.000000    Pakistan Rupee 0.000000    Syrian Lira 0.000000    Yemeni Riyal 0.000000
Q1724_C5	RE: RIAL to PHILIPPINE PESO? SM-Malls and Banks in the Philippines are NOT buying Qatari Riyals...I tried it myself, they only accept Saudi Riyals.  You can sell it at any Money Changers, just be careful! Have your "common sense" functions properly.. before, during and after selling. Get my point?

Q1733_C4	RE: Can anyone tell me the normal internet connection... Dont get 2 MB speed. Max you should consider is 1MB but for most purposes 512K is fine. Problem is connection to other continents is never fast so no use to get highest speed. When I test connection to North America it is never better than 375KB.   Mozaic is not available in all areas. I ordered Mozaic Dec 9, I asked on Dec 31 where installation guys were. Was told by Qtel that my area would not get it for a "few" months. Nice of them to let me know! NOT!  Get Landline, 512K or 1MB Internet and then Orbit Satellite TV.  When Vodafone is in their internet may be better.
Q1733_C5	RE: Can anyone tell me the normal internet connection... 512 kbps is a good speed for Home aplication..As said above..the 512kbps internet connection will cost you QR200 per month and then the Landline will cost you 33 QR per month...Altoghether 233QR per month...There was an offer from Q Tel for Moziac TV ... how ever it is not available in some areas in Qatar as of today...

Q1745	Not Coming Back Can anyone help.  Will I need to book a return flight even though I plan on not coming back to Qatar - i.e. will I get stopped at Qatar Airport even though i'll have an exit visa if i have a one way ticket?  Thanks
Q1745_C1	Umm and how will they know you have a one way ticket at the airport?
Q1745_C2	Besides it is none of their business at the check-in counters to know if you have a return ticket or not, or if you're coming back or not, it's entirely your prerogative.   If you need an excuse, "I am undecided on my date of return, so I will book it online when I feel it's time to come back" ;-)
Q1745_C3	your already have exit visa your already have exit visa dear... so no worries... they dont care if u will come back or not... what important is u have a plane ticket going home...
Q1745_C4	Pierre NO - the check in staff will not bother about if you have any outstanding dues (not saying that you have). And the Immigration Officers won't give a damn about if you don't have a return ticket, they only stop you if you're on repatriation and have outstanding dues.
Q1745_C5	All you need is the exit All you need is the exit visas and your tickets to leave! Many companies issue tickets for the workers to come back while they are on holiday - it is a common practice and we have done it many times.  How easy it is for some people to jump to conclusions that you are running away from debts - just ignore those comments and good luck for your next adventure, wherever it may be :)
Q1745_C6	If you have no plans tu If you have no plans to return, why not simply resign and do the right thing by the company? Doing a runner simply screws up the visa entitlements for someone else who might enjoy it here.

Q1745_C9	B2D - most 'bosses' are not B2D - most 'bosses' are not like you and you know that. Your word 'voluntarily' shows your respect for your workers (which is to be praised).   The OP seems to have more serious issues to be able to break free from his sponsor - and with children he needs to make sure to get back to the UK for the new school term, spend Christmas at home and and and.... Things which are very important to people like him and many others. Sometimes people just snap when the family is not happy - and even 1 week can be like HELL if you don't want to be where you are.
Q1745_C10	Even u can try by booking the Even u can try by booking the return ticket nd u can cancel the same from ur home country
Q1745_C11	All my collegues have only one-way ticket when going for vacation and our company do the booking of the return trip upon request.  So the one-way ticket is not an issue.  It's the EXIT permit that is very important!

Q1747_C6	I'm using Al Manhal and the I'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium, and the taste is not bad.  Once a week delivery though unless you call (they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is).  Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back, but delivered to your door!  My roommate also uses Wataniya, which for the first month is super service, multiple times a week.  Then seems to not be so super.  But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am).    The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles, and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new.  Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.

Q1758_C9	HSBC Middle East is NOT a franchise Dweller is incorrect: HSBC in Qatar is NOT a franchise.    HSBC Qatar is a Branch of HSBC Bank Middle East Ltd., which is chartered in Jersey.  It is (though a series of intemediary holding companies) wholly owned by HSBC Holdings PLC, the top level holding company for HSBC.  That being said, it is NOT a branch of the UK HSBC Bank, nor is it a subsidiary of the UK HSBC Bank.  The Jersey bank is supervised by the Jersey regulator and the top level holding company is supervised by the UK FSA on a consolidated basis.    Should you take comfort in all of that? I leave it up to you, but it is a part of HSBC in more than name only.

Q1765	Spare the Rod and Spoil the Child? Who agrees that modern Education system spoils the creativity of students?
Q1765_C1	Yep MM Somehow the thought of hitting ,even lightly, another's child is just wrong. For teachers there are many better ways to discipline a child than resorting to the kinda corporal punishment our teachers used. Now that was quite brutal and far from bettering us it certainly encouraged naughty kids like I was to be more naughtier as a form of revenge and defiance.
Q1765_C2	We are now in hi-technology We are now in hi-technology era..accept it, our current children time is different from what we have 50 years ago.
Q1765_C3	In today's day i think we In today's day i think we should just take away their Facebook privileges :P
Q1765_C4	Modern education spoils Modern education spoils creativity??? I seem to be living in another world altogether!!!!   Agree with both Mimi and Fatimah. Whilst Im against harsh disciplining a smack once in a while when the situation demands it is ok.  Then again when your kid becomes a teen then begin the 'tyrannical' years! They will say I HATE U atleast once a day cuz we dont allow them to be 'like their friends' or' their moms allow them'.....:)  At the end of the day depends on your rapport with your child.
Q1765_C5	Not always Marco. And do you Not always Marco. And do you have kids??? I hope not! Esp with that attitude!
Q1765_C6	I think parents should smack I think parents should smack their children whenever wherever, we're meant to be together.. Errrr... sorry lost the track  Jokes apart .. I don't see anything wrong with parents smacking their kids "occasionally" and when necessary.. but again do not punish your children in front of others because that would make them feel humiliated and ultimately go rebellious.I have seen many arab (parents) smacking their children in public like malls and parks etc. which in my opinion is TOTALLY wrong..  Otherwise, all is good.. i got punished a lot as a kid.. but look at me now.. All the girls love me .. i can still take some smacking from my father.. :P

Q1765_C9	Smack That! Smack That!
Q1765_C10	i think whacking the children i think whacking the children stiffles the creativity and makes them scared to think of new ideas.  However i think if used sparingly and with the other righ ingredients (coaching, love.....), it can be helpful.
Q1765_C11	I was talking about parents I was talking about parents smacking their kids..teachers on the other hand are a big No No.  On that note..when i was smacked for something i did wrong i always found other creative ways to do more naughty things so that should answer your question. :P
Q1765_C12	Modern education system Modern education system spoils the creativity of children? Where did you get that from?
Q1765_C13	Agree with you Fatimah, the Agree with you Fatimah, the occasional smack, on the right occasion, can work.    But totally against teachers smacking kids.    Smacking is a serious punishment and shouldn't be given out lightly, and it needs to come from a loving parent.
Q1765_C14	Agree with TDKR and Agree with TDKR and Tinkerbell10..."Modern education spoils creativity??? I seem to be living in another world altogether!!!! or where did you hear that?". ...:)   As for smacking, I dont think either at school or at home it is required unless the parents give up on children for any reason. As I understood, as I grew, time & patience was the key with parents. And so never got smacked either at home or at school. There were tough sessions specially with parents but they were patient enough to tell me or my brother and sister their POV listening to our POV, without the mindset that they being eldest are only right and at times these sessions would run for days without any hostility or bad feeling.

Q1781	Is Satellite Internet available here? Recomme Hello All,   Is Satellite Internet available here? Recommended Providers and Pricing?  Apartments where I am at are struggling with abominably slow internet access. Does anyone have experience with Satellite Internet here in Qatar?
Q1781_C1	Maybe just call Qtel and Maybe just call Qtel and find out what the problem is? I pay for a 4MB line and actually connect at 4.8M down / 650k up. Its not blazing fast compared to the western world, but for what it is I can connect to torrents upward of 500k per second. Qtel also offers an 8M line, but there is a restriction on the distance to the local hub. I think they said 800m and mine just happens to be ~1200m away.  The tech on the phone did inform me they are working on Fiber Optic, but would not be available for another year (which probably means 2 in Doha time). You can get up to 50MB download speeds in the US with Fiber internet.  The biggest problem here is the pricing. Qtel charge a whopping 400QAR for a 4MB line. Anywhere else this speed can be had for a fraction of the cost. Even 5 years ago I was paying the equivalent of ~150QAR for a 4MB line in the US. Prices here are absolutely rediculous!

Q1784_C1	RE: Can I hold my valid Dubai Resident Visa while I get... I don't think you can hold two GCC Visa, unless it is the same company you are working for and they apply the visa, i think you would have to cancel Dubai visa in order to get your Qatar visa stamped on your passport.   This is what i have also only heard, so please get it confirmed.

Yes, I know it's nothing new, but it really is time the police enforced the law concerning this.  That kid would just have been mince if he'd had an accident.  Makes me want to cry.
Q1785_C8	new rules : In a major move to curb the growing number of accidents and incidents of reckless driving on Qatars roads, the government yesterday promulgated a new Traffic Law, stipulating severe penalties for violators including a point system which would ultimately lead to the cancellation of a habitual offenders driving license.  Decree No 19 of 2007, issued by HH the Deputy Emir and Heir Apparent Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, stated that a driving license may be suspended for three months when the total violations reached 14 points for the first time.  If the same person gathered 12 points again, his license would be suspended for six months, nine months on the accumulation of the next 10 points and one year for the next eight points.  Ultimately, a driving license may be cancelled if the same offender earned six points for the fifth time.  The penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced. The violator will have to pay a minimum fine of QR 3,000 and a maximum fine of QR 10,000. He is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year.   Motorists who commit violations such as driving with no authorized license, driving under the influence of liquor, driving in the opposite direction of traffic flow, escaping from the accident site, causing sound and air pollution and exceeding the speed limit would be punishable by imprisonment from one month to three years or fined QR10,000 to 50,000 or both.  According to the new law, the punishment for the following offences are also the same as mentioned above: Not wearing seat belts, allowing children below 10 years sit in the front passenger seat, not giving way to official motorcades and the vehicles of the police, civil defense and ambulances, not leaving enough space between two vehicles and motorcyclists allowing another passenger sit behind them (pillion riding).  The law stipulates that the driver and the front seat passenger should wear seat belts all the time.  Cyclists should keep to the right side of the road and should ride in one line. Motorcyclists are not allowed to ride on one wheel. Both should wear helmets.    Violation Points System Violators of traffic rules will be given negative points as follows: Jumping the red light 7 Driving in the opposite direction 6 Driving under the influence of alcohol 6 Exceeding the maximum speed 4 Driving recklessly and dangerously 4 Driving with defective brakes 4 Driving with inappropriate license 3 Driving with stripped or invalid license 3 Violating norms of public morality 3 Driving an unregistered vehicle 3 Driving a vehicle without number plates 3 Unauthorized changes made to number plates 3 Providing wrong information to pass the technical inspection 3 Using the vehicle for the wrong purpose 3 Blocking the flow of traffic intentionally 3 Driving a vehicle without a proper silencer 3 Driving a polluting vehicle 3 Driving a vehicle that leaks any material that can damage the road 3 Driving a vehicle which drops loads which can endanger the public safety 3 Driving on the embankment 3 Making a wrong U-turn 3 Changing a vital part of the vehicle without a written permission from the authorities 3 Giving the license to someone who has no license 2 Driving a vehicle with unclear number plates 2 Driving with only one number plate, or changing their shape or detail 1 Refraining from giving driving license to traffic police 1 Trucks violating the load conditions 1 Trucks violating the width, length, or weight regulations of the vehicle 1 Driving a technically unsafe vehicle 1 Using lights, horns, microphones, or other machines against the law 1 Disobeying traffic signs 1      [img_assist|nid=417|title=leo dude|desc=happiness comes only once dont miss it|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0]
Q1785_C9	HAve to say this one covers HAve to say this one covers pretty much anything  "Violating norms of public morality 3"  It will only be an issue for non locals anyway.  "The penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced. The violator will have to pay a minimum fine of QR 3,000 and a maximum fine of QR 10,000. He is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year"  The above is a joke.I have seen 4 Police officers either calling or texting when driving.   So to sum up,Waste of time. The worst drivers will not get penalised.

Q1804_C3	There really isn't any There really isn't any websites here like you are describing. There is no Ikea or Best Buy either. No Wal Marts, Targets, things of that nature. I would say if you have to make arrangements for your house before you get here, get a furnished place. You will have to hunt around the malls (not really any American stores there) and also the souqs for furnishings. Hope that helps.  Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )
Q1804_C4	WEBSITE Visit www.emaxme.com, they are present in many countries and will atleast give u some idea about electronics.
Q1804_C5	Hi. Been recently looking at Hi. Been recently looking at accomodation and the costs between furnished and unfurnished. In my opinion it is better to rent unfurnished.

Whatever you vividly imagine, Ardently desire, Sincerely believe and Enthusiastically act upon, Must inevitably come to pass.

Q1811	Parent visa for  above 70 year age I like to bring my parent for 1 Or two weeks in Qatar.I tried for tourist visa at airport.but, they rejected.Now, authority advice to book only five star hotel for tourist visa.it is impossible to spend money for five star hotel for me.is it possible anytype (including tourist)of visa,which can bring my parent here?If so, please send form and tell me process. thanks in advance.
Q1811_C1	RE: Parent visa for  above 70 year age No. There are no visas available easily for persons above 60 years of age. The hotel-sponsored visa is the only type. You need not approach a five-star hotel for this. There are several cheaper hotels in Doha which can sponsor such a visa. The cost would be around US$100 to US$150 per day, depending upon how much the hotel charges for one room per night.
Q1811_C2	RE: Parent visa for  above 70 year age Agreed with METRO

Once there select the tourist visa section then select a joint tourist visa and fill in the form for each parent, you will need their passport details.  I did this last year for my parents, both over 70.  Be careful though as you only get 1 month from the date of creation so make sure it covers them for the whole stay, you cannot choose a start date.  They give you an instant answer and it only cost 100 riyals per visa.  Good luck :)
Q1811_C4	RE: Parent visa for  above 70 year age Go to Immigration department and ask someone there. I have heard that there are people who can get you a visa for over 60 parents but he will charge you for his service. Please dont send me any PM that's all I have heard.

Q1826	Satellite TV and Internet 2 Questions:  1. What is the current quality of internet in Doha? Is it fast enough compared to other Western countries? Can you livestream videos fast enough?  2. Are there any satellite broadcasts which show Australian sport? I'm wanting to watch the NRL which airs every week when I head there next year. Usually on Fox Sports and Channel 9.  Thanks.
Q1826_C1	RE: Satellite TV and Internet Internet is fine, unlimited and able to cope with streaming no problem. Expensive though especially compared to UK. Satellite here is pretty rubbish both in quality and choice. Hopefully some Ozzies can confirm but certainly have seen NZ rugby on one of the channels.

Q1831_C6	RE: is it possible to enter doha airport with out a... Marycatherine,  Perhaps , you meant Al Maha services.. Consider going to the Al Maha counter for a hassle free service.   Give your families flight iterinary to the Al Maha agent inside the arrival terminal and pay a small fee for their services.  Once your family arrives at the arrival terminal, ask them to proceed to the Al Maha outlet BEFORE the immigration counter to their left.. Tell them to announce to the Al Maha representative about their names.  They will be asked to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge. An  Al Maha rep will collect their passports and visas and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minutes.  Your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggages. They will direct someone to load the luggages onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them   Cheers

Q1837	Very urgent pls pls help new born visa my baby born in qatar ,7 days old has got one year visit visa as my wife and myself both r on different sponsorship. My query is that now i want to go to india and comebck within a month. So if v live the country and comeback will there b any problem for my baby to re enter qatar as his visa is one year visit visa {as per rule they issued visit bcoz mother is not on hubands sponsorship}
Q1837_C1	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa one year visit visa ?????what is this ? somebody give u wrong information .i think this is a residence visa if visa printed as- ENTRY PURPOSE-FAMILY VIS& expiry date one year from birth date me and my wife are under different sponsor i have one year old baby and my daughters visa printed as family visit  we visit india two times last year
Q1837_C2	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa i think you're having a wrong picture in your mind. if your baby is born in qatar, he/she will NOT be issued with VISIT VISA. visit visa is issued only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visiting.   if you have done the birth certificate and have signed the documents at CID (due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife), your baby is issued with the RP.  I think it's better you show your babys RP (or visa as you say) to somebody who can read arabic and get confirmed.
Q1837_C3	RE:  Very urgent pls pls help new born visa Something not right here ... My husband and I are with different sponsors. Our baby was born a few months back, and was issued a family visa. Quite straightforward. The only extra step is u'll need to go to the CID office and show them ur papers. Once the baby gets his passport, u'll need to go back there with a copy of the passport. (No idea why though )

Q1839	Fuwayrit Beach We are planning to go to Fuwayrit City soon. anybody can sketch me how to reach there.  Thanks in advance.
Q1839_C1	RE: Fuwayrit Beach Hit up Al Shamal road and start counting your distance from Landmark Shopping mall. Keep heading North on Al Shamal road (NOT Al Khor Road which takes you straight to Al Khor and passes the Lusail Intl. Circuit on your left) for about 75.55km  You will come to an interchange (still under construction) with a small blue sign BEFORE the bridge reading [ Al Fuwairit > ]  You will want to take the dirt road with that sign and keep driving down a very bumpy road until you hit the fishing village. To get to the beach, take a left before the village and follow the unpaved roads to the beach.  Got a GPS? Also, wouldn't recommend going there without a 4x4, some spots have nasty soft sand. Check it out on Google Earth before you go. Feel free to PM.  Good luck!
Q1839_C2	RE: Fuwayrit Beach head northwest to al shamal road.  landmark set KM to "0"  after 77kms turn right.  after 3.9 kms turn left for 450meters. youl be in the area.
Q1839_C3	RE: Fuwayrit Beach whaiQL's blog is really nice, with pictures too. You turn left just before you enter the village, the road looks like the 5th picture from the top in whaiQL's blog. Trees on either side and a wooden barricade.  Again, to the 4x4 issue, some spots do have soft sand. You can probably find a way through on hard ground though. It's not an unpopular beach, so if you do get stuck, there should be someone around to dig you out, especially on the weekends.

How often do we get big-name DJ's like Tiesto here in Doha?  I'm definitely in for the Tiesto show!!! Anyone else on the board go to these events?  Please - if you find any more upcoming shows - please post!  EDIT: I don't see Doha listed on Tiesto's website :-(  -R

Q1849_C9	Jay which ir ur group on Jay which ir ur group on facebook ??
Q1849_C10	Master_Jay - do you DJ at Master_Jay - do you DJ at clubs, just for fun..??? What style do you like to spin?  I'm not sure who all might read this thread or topic - but these shows should be a great time. The music and atmosphere will be great - and you can be sure the environment will break down language and cultural barriers.  Did anyone here go to David Guetta in April? Just wondering how the show went - how was the crowd...did anyone get rooms for after-parties?
Q1849_C11	I'm not a Hey cnadnaan....  I'm not a "hardcore" follower of the music...but I really enjoy Trance and House, and tend to listen to it most of the time while driving, etc..  I actually like Tiesto's older offerings a little better than his latest production. I think I burned up Nyana in my CD player a few years ago...:-)  I went to the Pearl Lounge I think on a Thursday - and there was a really good DJ there not too long ago - can't remember his name. He played a great mix of music, some house, some Hip-Hop, some Arabic - a little bit of everything - and kept the crowd moving really well. I think I like that better than anything else - a DJ that can read the crowd - and feel what they are reacting to.  My favorite DJ is probably Sasha...I really like Markus Schulz too.
Q1849_C12	if  ur big fan of house or if  ur big fan of house or EDM....place to be is crystal lounge..Its in W hotel....dey bring amazing guest dj's..

Q1852_C5	1. In UK Eng Qatar..  FYI  1. In a Allh (  ) is an Arabic term evoked by Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu and Bengali speakers to indicate hope for an aforementioned event to occur in the future. The phrase translates into English as "God willing" or "If it is God's will", sometimes spoken as DV, the Latin abbreviation for Deo volente or simply "hopefully".  2. Usage of Insha'Allah derives from Islamic scripture, Surat Al Kahf (18):24 : "And never say of anything, 'I shall do such and such thing tomorrow. Except (with the saying): 'If God wills!' And remember your lord when you forget..."  And religion is the first and foremeost part of Muslims, and our all affairs are controlled by teachings under Islam.... so where ever a true Muslim is.... spirit of Islam is there.  Let me know if you need further clarifications.  Think like a man of Action..........act like a man of Thoughts!!!!

Q1854_C1	Ooh wait, if your family is Ooh wait, if your family is going to send them on through regular post, it could sometimes take months for your books to get here. My advice is to find a mail forwarding service in the UK. We have one in the US. I order from anywhere, they send the order to my PO BOX in Florida, then the mail forwarding service sends it through DHL and it gets delivered to my husband's office here. It is kind of expensive, but our items get here in 3 to 4 days from leaving Florida.    Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )

Q1856_C2	DERMATIX there is a product called dermatix  it is used by most surgeons and dermatologist  it is very god for new scars
Q1856_C3	owen.. you made me laugh and owen.. you made me laugh and cry at the same time..Chicken pox??.. isn't it a kids' illness, particularly those under age 12? poor thing.. i am really sorry to hear it.. :( here are some advices: Get Rid of Chickenpox Scars Step1 Talk to a dermatologist. Have your skin and scars evaluated by a professional before you try any products or home remedies. A dermatologist will have many different options for you to consider.  Step2 Apply sandalwood oil and Vitamin-E onto your skin. If you scars are not as deep or old, you can rub some sandalwood oil Vitamin-E based products onto your scars. Do this consistently for a few months until the scars have healed.  Step3 Try laser treatment. If the scars are old or very deep, creams and lotions will most likely not work. You might have to consider removing these types of scars with an intense laser treatment at your dermatologist's office.  Step4 Consider excision by your dermatologist or doctor. Excision is the removal of scars by cutting them off and stitching the skin closed. This option is especially suitable for deep scarring. You will still have some scarring, but it will be much less noticeable than the chickenpox scars.  Step5 Get a Microdermabrasion treatment. Microdermabrasion is a deep facial peel that removes a very fine layer of skin. This process will remove scars from on the surface of your skin. Get this process done at a clinic or certified spa for best results.   Good luck sweetie.. :)   <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q1856_C5	owen, bless your heart!!! I feel for you honey...had the chicken pox when I was 25 years old and 3 months pregnant with my first child. (remind me to thank my mom again for keeping me "safe" from all those other kids with the pox, when I was little!!)  Do what QS said...and I was going to say Vitamin E capsules work wonders for scars. Just get the capsules from GNC, puncture one end of the capsule and apply..rub it in throughly...keep OUT of the sun for at least 6 months (or use really strong sunscreen)tho as new skin, such as scars, will tan differently than other skin...

Q1856_C15	might ask a doc, but if you can get ano nighttime antihistamines that should help with the itching also..Valtrex is an antiviral med...and although the chickenpox is viral, it won't really help with the itching.  You will also be contagious until the very LAST pox has dried up and fallen off...so take your time and get well!!!

Q1864	Buying used Land Cruiser - Need suggestions? Hi,  I want to buy Pre-owned/used Land Cruiser 2009/2010 model. I have already visited Toyota certified pre-owned cars, Qatar Living, Qatarsales, Oasis, etc. but still confused among them. I have noticed Toyota certified cars are cheaper than any other used car showroom but their cars are under sun; therefore, don't feel comfortable with this fact.   Can anyone suggest, where should I buy used Land Cruiser?
Q1864_C1	Nothings gona happen if the Nothings gona happen if the cars are parked under the sun. They usually don't last that in that lot either.

Q1883	Clothes prices in Doha? I am wondering if the prices in Doha are higher than in the UK. Can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 QR? Just want to get an idea. Thanks
Q1883_C1	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? I think clothes prices are higher in UK than here..but it's always wiser to buy clothes during Sale season as u can really get good deals during those times..
Q1883_C2	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands  (such as BHS, Next, M&S, H&M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to 1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to 1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession.   If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.
Q1883_C3	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment. Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good, so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there!!
Q1883_C4	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? A pair of undies are costing Qr 45 here...
Q1883_C5	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? Thanks, guys. That was really helpful. I am still in the UK. But soon will be moving.I am going to bring everything from here I guess. As the prices here are fantastic now like linen trousers at Next on sale are 8 (44 Qrs). So don't think anything could beat that on price and quality.
Q1883_C6	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? yes u cud surely get a pair of jeans for 60QR .... but that was sooo 5 years ago!
Q1883_C7	RE: Clothes prices in Doha? um. i'm sure clothing prices in uk is more expensive than in doha. 60-100 riyal jeans? you could work on that. i'm sure there's a place where you can find a good deal. ;o)

One is focused on her own beauty (narcissism). Another is responsible for man hunting. And third - unstable and psychopathic - is a centre of lack of confidence, which is expressed in the maniacal obsession that everyone hates her... what a contradictive psycho case... it looks like an epidemic among trolls, I hope not contagious though, and will stay in their community only...  <i> <b> ********************* "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."  </b> Oliver Wendell Holmes</i>   <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">

Q1898	Italians in Doha Hi,   I've just received an offer for an expat job in Doha, some 120.000$ and I'm wondering if there is an Italian comunity there  Diego
Q1898_C1	no imnatroll I make more than that and I am not a Treasury Specialist :-)) ROFL!!!!
Q1898_C2	verisimilitude My CEO earns hell no. of times than HIM. He is also not a treasury analyst right?.   What if you are in a bigger position than him ? :)

Q1898_C4	I've noticed a lot of people I've noticed a lot of people mentioning their salary on Qatarliving.   ~*Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~
Q1898_C5	okay... seriously... I know a bunch of guys in one of the Multinational Banks in treasury who make more than that and this was two years ago... Having said that, I am no expert on finance... All I know is that these were guys with about 10 to 15 years work ex like Lorenteggio...
Q1898_C6	Loren... If its one of the national banks, the offer would be less than that of some of the multinational financial institutions... 'some'... not all...
Q1898_C7	Lorenteggio, it is alright. Lorenteggio, it is alright. You are not the first person to do so. But its just the way people could ask. Maybe something like, how much would suffice for a good life in Qatar. People on Qatarliving vary in status and the salaries vary as well. People earn QR2000 to QR 150000 a month. So, it might hurt people to know that others are making what they would save in 350 years.   Just my opinion.   I wish you a happy stay in Qatar once you arrive.   ~*Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~

Q1898_C15	There is a thriving community.... There is a thriving community....with a very active embassy.  But why do you Italian guys keep switching-off the Aircon and opening the windows?...lol
Q1898_C16	i'm not in Ciao Lorenteggio i'm not in finance so couldn'tcomment how that offer compares with the local rate, but I would say that you have to judge how much better of you'll be than at home.  Cost of living is definitely higher than in italy, but depends a lot if you have accomodation included.  you're going to pay at least QAR14,000 per month for somewhere OK to live.  If it's only a little above average salary at home then I'd say it isn't going to make you a lot better off, but this depends on your tax situation.  Not sure how the italian tax works, but no tax payable here. You have to bear in mind that while Qatar is very safe and you can buy most things here (prosciuto excepted!), it's not the most comfortable or exciting place to live. so you'll end up spending a lot on flights and holidays to stay sane. Good luck FG
Q1898_C17	To fairgrace Thank for the comment; as far as I've seen cost of living is higher here in Europe than in Qatar thanks to the strong EUR
Q1898_C18	Lorenteggio, se ti capita Lorenteggio, se ti capita anche solo di venire qui qualche gg giusto per farti un idea di cosa sia vivere in Qatar (io ci sto da + di 1 anno) mandami  un msg in privato e ci mettiamo in comunicazione. Saluti Mauro PS: e' un OTTIMO salario se hai full expact benefits!!!

Q1904_C6	RE: How to track lost mobile ? Well here is the thing, It depends upon the system in place. If they want they can trace the mobile phone with approximate location. there is an IMEI of each mobile mobile. And when ever a mobile phone get registered to the network or makes a phone call or sends SMS, there is an entry recorded in database with SIM number + IMEI number. So if someone is using your friend's mobile phone, they definitely have the record of it. And they can trace the guy as well.  the best way is to goto Police and report it.
Q1904_C7	RE: How to track lost mobile ? Do not worry . Go to police station and they will register your complain and through your IMIE no they will trace your the lost phone even your cell is off even he remove your sim card. Through IMEI police will trace the  guy as well.

Q1927_C5	u2, no, no, NO! You cannot u2, no, no, NO! You cannot pay for a visa, it is illegal. And just to scare you, I knew a Nigerian who did pay for a visa, they gave him a visa that said he was coming to work as a bricklayer. Guess what he is doing in Qatar? He's a bricklayer! Making nothing, working his tail off and living in a trailer with 16 other people! And he has a graduate education. What can be done for this man? NOTHING! If he leaves his job he can be arrested and jailed. I hate to say he deserves it, but you should learn from his folly. He would tell you the same thing. Mandi

Q1932_C1	I'll try to get an appraisal I'll try to get an appraisal in Toyota trade-in section. If their offer will not suits my expectation, then probably this goes for an auction to direct buyers Anyone knows how much the market value for this model?
Q1932_C2	Yes. Trade in is less Yes. Trade in is less problem/head ache BUT less cost.  Sell it to direct buyers will earn you little sum of money compare to trade-in but you have to deal with different types of people.

Q1935	Client Approval Hi,  I have accepted offer to work in Qatar as a civil engineer, but the company told me not to hand my notice in until get the Client Approval. I have not come across this client approval before. I would appreciate your advice and any idea how long this approval will take and is it easy to get this approval?  Thanks for your help in advance.  Mego
Q1935_C1	No , it's client approval No , it's client approval which is approval should be taken from the main project client before starting the visa process.
Q1935_C2	Sounds like good advice from Sounds like good advice from your employer
Q1935_C3	Yes, true they should get Yes, true they should get prior approval from the client or Consultant before they are able to hire you, means a copy of your CV is sent to them as well and you might be interviewed by them too..
Q1935_C4	All jobs in Qatar on All jobs in Qatar on contingent on your getting a visa, so even if you come and go through the last few stages, your visa may or may not be approved.  You would have to leave then and no compensation would be provided.  Only you can decide if you want to take that leap.  Thousands are successful, but if you are one of the very few who are not it can be devastating.
Q1935_C5	It is the time required to It is the time required to get your CV approved by the ultimate client (Ashghal etc.). It's for your benefit to get you approved before you hand your notice. As someone mentioned the visa process may still collapse but at least the client approval stage will confirm that the client will pay for your work lol.   Your grade and salary is likely to be based on that as well.  It took approx. 10-14 days in my case.
Q1935_C6	Any more thoughts Any more thoughts
Q1935_C7	Yes, client approval is Yes, client approval is generally the preferred way to work for engineering consultancies. The main reason is that companies dont want to hire someone from overseas and bring them all the way to Qatar and then find out that the client does not like them for some reasons like lack of experience, etc. Therefore, to save themselves the hassle and money, companies usually hire people officially once client has seen their CV and is happy to have them on the job. Hope this helps!

Q1940_C18	 prado                        peace :)
Q1940_C19	Prado is perfect. Prado is perfect.
Q1940_C20	Hello Omar! Your question is difficult to answer and the only person who knows the answer is you.If you want a mean powerful offroader that can seat 7 in comfort then Prado is your choice. On the other hand you want a slick city cruiser that can manage minimal offroading then go for the CR-V. It looks real nice if you mod it just right. Both cars are good value for money. If it is the 2.4L Prado you are looking at then definitely go for CR-V as the 2.4L mill which performs well in the Camry isn't good enough to get the gargantuan across town.  Ride comfort is higher in the CR-V and handling is near saloon levels. The Prado on the other hand is belittled by the humble Corolla around a round about. Road noise levels are also higher in the Prado especially when wearing Bridgestone donuts. You also get more toys for the money you pay on a CR-V.   Prado can go just about anywhere with it's optional 4WD system with rear and central diff lock. It's got a huge petrol tank that takes ages to fill and ages to empty. The value never depreciates and looks like it never will as the 2010 Prado MAY soon turn out to be damp squib and a POSSIBLE chink in Toyota's armor as full time 4WD may not be everyone's cup of tea.  In the end listen to your heart. If you need further help PM me as I just love cars and all things related...  also check out www.drivearabia.com for more opinions and reviews.

Q1961_C4	mjamille you just use the mjamille you just use the windows media player and put the CD and click RIP it will convert the .cda to .mp3.
Q1961_C5	The .cda yes, basically: The .cda files are representations of CD audio tracks and do not contain the actual pulse code modulation (PCM) information.  Cda files can be played only from a CD-ROM.  This means you have to 'rip' the song from the CD using a software, there are plenty of them around the net (I've been using Soundforge and it's very cool even if maybe is quite difficult for a newbie to understand).
Q1961_C6	I am sure you can use I am sure you can use Ashampoo to rip it and convert it to mp3.  Perhaps other softwares such as Nero can do it as well... I am not aware.  Google search, perhaps you find a freeware for that purpose.

Q1969	Can my wife get a job on my work permit? Hello all,  We are in the process of relocating to Doha. I will be issued a work permit that will allow my wife and kid to be resident too.  But can my wife get a job using this permit?  Or will she will be able to get a work permit easily once in country and able to secure another job?  Pls help as this is very important to us. It might determine if my wife will agree to leave her current job in the UK or not.  Thanks
Q1969_C1	No Problem Yes, as you have a family status your wife can get a job here. She will be in your sponsorship and once she has a job offer the company would be applying for a job permit.  The thing you have to consider is her chances of getting a job as it depends also on her experience and minimum salary you would be expecting.  Anyways may god guide you.  Cheers, Steve

Q1976	Difference between netbook and note book I need to buy a laptop for my kid. I am considering to buy a netbook since it is cheaper. It will be used for MS office (word, excel, powerpoint, access etc), checking encarta and playing games on internet (facebook games, roblox etc).

Q1976_C1	RE: Difference between netbook and note book Buy a netbook !

I have a MSI Wind U100 and it has been fine as a back-up for me when travelling. I use my desktop for all the graphics hungry work. The nice thing about the netbook is that it is light, has a long battery life and is easy too carry around.

Q1980_C63	Indecent proposal...whatchamacallit...whatever....you are weak if you think you are weak!  I'm not being biotchy but:  - <b>to cherry23</b>: Your company have an HR Officer, right? Why not discuss this with them...to give it appropriate action.   Secondly, if you gonna complain to the police, you better stand firm with your complaints...as this would be a long, tedious, messy situation wherein your work will get jeopardized in the process. They ould easily turn the table on you, you being new in the job , in the company. It';; be your words against your manager.  Third, Maybe your manager misread your actions towards him. You being amiable to him and friendly may have been read/understood that you like him...maybe you should do a self-assessment.   Fourth, If you really want to keep your job and the sexual harrassment to stop...TELL HIM FRANKLY. He's educated enough to take the point. He may do something stupid for being rejected but as long as you do your job well, he can't have anything to use against you to terminate you.   From what you're posting about the situation being "complicated"...it's not.  YOU WANT THE MONEY FOR THE OVERTIME he's giving you...but YOU DON'T LIKE THE ATTENTION...THEN SPEAK OUT YOUR THOUGHTS AND TELL HIM THAT YOU CAME HERE TO WORK AND EARN...NOT TO DO ANY TOMFOOLERY....  I hope you get my point....and don't be so naive.
Q1980_C64	tinkerbell10 - i just hope tinkerbell10 - i just hope you are right. but at least she should have move away from that pervert and not letting him kissed her. because this guy can say "ohh.. she is not resisting, i can do what i want".
Q1980_C65	Cherry something is not right Cherry something is not right here... you say that lately he has started kissing your neck... hello - but how does he get that close to kiss you on your neck?? its not an easy thing to do so he has to be pretty close and comfortable to be able to do that and what about you ?? you just stand there quietly while he does it.  i know one thing, if any guy came that close to me I would certainly notice and move away... So I tend to think there is more to the story.. maybe you were nice and cosy with the guy and now that he wants more you are panicking... and to tell him you have a BF well thats just real clever...  SOrry I dont buy your story - there is something else you are not telling us....
Q1980_C66	And another thing... I am And another thing... I am sure your office/company has a complaint policy or greivance policy... why go to police and make it into some great big story of he knows this and that person....  simple answer - report to your HR department or to his boss and get it over and done with.... Like I said before - big story for nothing and there is something you have not told us which is basically that you would rather have the money etc then complain about him.  Where is your pride !!!!
Q1980_C67	If you are really interested If you are really interested in getting this guy off your back, draw the line in stone, not sand.   Most guys do understand when a woman replies with a firm "No", and they usually back off. It's when you keep moving the line that they start playing around. So be strong and say "No, Thankyou, NOT INTERESTED". You have to decide what is more important to you, a few measly extra bucks or your self respect and dignity.

Q1980_C71	cherry listen do this and cherry listen do this and think about it... your boss is lebaness so the higher boss is qatari, dont worry to lose your job because he is only a GM there but he is not your sponsor, the qatari is the one who will kick him out of the office.. if you not scared now.. this are the step.. before entering your boss office take your mobile with u and start recording something.. if u can do video more solid evidence and voice record is good also but u need or conversation is involved about harrasing to u, do u get what i mean. if you get that go to the police... or use that evidence to scare him away... and dont smile on him dont give him anything to deserve your kindness..   trust me on this... because we are the same on this kind of situation... in this country u need to be strong and smart specially to us girls..
Q1980_C72	..tell your BF about your ..tell your BF about your problem, maybe he can  help you also.
Q1980_C73	@jackmohan2007 ahihi..."boyfriend-S"
Q1980_C74	Amazing that this would even be a question.

Anywhere else I think this would be a given: report him to his superior and the police.

Q1983	Language barrier We are an English speaking family planning to bring a maid from Indonesia who cannot communicate at all in English. Please guide me how i could train her to speak English, since she will be taking care of my kids.
Q1983_C1	RE: Language barrier There is no point of bringing her my dear .because the time needed to teach her enlish wont be less then the time needed for you kid to be a teenager   my advice ,go find another one best of luck
Q1983_C2	RE: Language barrier I find they pick up language quickly but you will need to speak to her non-stop all the time. Maybe this will not be ideal if both of you are working and the kids are st home. I find it helps when she plays with the kids a lot as kids have a great deal of patience and they feel more comfortable around the kids than adults as there is little embarrasment.

Q1989	Is it difficult to be vegan in Doha? Hi  I'm considering moving to Doha and have been vegan for 4 years. I'm wondering how difficult it is to find vegan food products - things like soy milk, tofu, nutritional yeast...   Any vegans in Doha have any insight?  Thanks!
Q1989_C1	RE: Is it difficult to be vegan in Doha? Soy milk and tofu are available in all major supermarkets but I am not sure about the yeast.
Q1989_C2	RE: Is it difficult to be vegan in Doha? There are a lot of vegans here, mainly from the subcontinent.  I don't know about the yeast in particular but the rest is available anywhere.
Q1989_C3	RE: Is it difficult to be vegan in Doha? Great! Thanks cherukkan and marycatherine. Good to know I'll be in good company and won't starve!   PollyJ there are lots of great reasons to be vegan:  animal rights, health, lower environmental impact and peace of mind to name a few. I feel much healthier since becoming vegan. I have more energy, I don't get as tired after eating meals, I lost weight and I'm happier knowing my actions are inline with my thoughts and ethics.  Of course, everyone is different and for some people (like Boer) its harder to give up the things they've always loved. For me it was a great choice and I've never looked back.   Give it a go! I promise it's not as hard as you think!
Q1989_C4	RE: Is it difficult to be vegan in Doha? You wouldnt have a problem being vegan in Doha, besides lacking the Daiya cheese that i love so much. Check out some indian restaurants around!

Q1991_C9	eddy.. I would not advise coming here without a job or someone to stay with.   Finding a job is hard work and can take some time. Doha is expensive and you will not last more than 2 weeks on uS$700.  It is best to save the airfare and try applying for jobs first..

Q1994	Can I buy GOLD in Qatar Hi,  I will be travelling to Qatar in the first quarter of 2009. I heard that Gold and other electronics goods are cheaper in Qatar when compared to other countries. Could you suggest me the things which are cheap in Qatar and reasonably high in India. I also heard that Gold is one among them. Can someone give me some pointers on What can be purchased in Qatar.
Q1994_C1	Gold is the same price the Gold is the same price the world around. The only difference is the "making charge" and tax for some countries such as Egypt. Dubai probably has the least extra price on top of the gold's value for that day. If you don't know the day's price for, say, 22k gold, don't try to buy some. The merchant will have you figured out in a flash. Mandi
Q1994_C2	Yes same prices but the desgins are totally different from any were else
Q1994_C3	I found Three items here in I found Three items here in Qatar are cheaper than in India 1. Petrol 2. Saffron 3. Dates ( But you have to  collect it from the road side palm tree)
Q1994_C4	NOT TRUE! I think you heard it wrong from somebody, compare to Saudi and Dubai, all the stuff are much costlier here. So, think twice before you pick something from Qatar. Yeah, you will get pure Gold from any GCC country than India. Happy shopping!!!!.
Q1994_C5	Gold Price in qatar  higher than India In qatar gold price is cheap compare than india, but making charges are high. so final comparsion qatar rates are higher than india Exampletoday rate in india u can have 1 gm(22Ct) 1250, but qatar 1 gm(22ct) 100QR(inclulde making charge)= 1310.

Q1995	Will Egypt turn into Pakistan? After the hard fought gains of the revolution it seems the prize of the Egyptians might be for them to mirror events in Pakistan. An army that is always involved in the politics, corruption from all sides and frequently changing governments.  No country can prosper and move forward without stability and with the army interfering once more in politics does the next decade for Egypt look like the last decade for Pakistan?
Q1995_C1	indeed brit, but in Pakistan indeed brit, but in Pakistan Supreme Court is taking things in to their Hand...   Just like the Disqualification of PM of Pakistan Yesterday...

Be it Marshal Law or Democratic Government, Corruption is every where, but then again Why do More then 75% of Pakistanis Support the Army....  Egypt never had  Revolution in the First Place, Face was changed but Until Now Egyptian Army are Calling the Shots..
Q1995_C5	Hi Hey Idiot ,
Q1996	Special Ed Schools It looks like we might be headed to Doha with my 11 year-old son with Down Syndrome, and we've been scouring the Internet for schools.  We are looking for recommendations from anyone who has first-hand knowledge of special ed for an 11 year-old, or can refer us to someone or an organization with any information.  Also, does anyone know of a Down Syndrome Support Group?  Many thanks! Sam
Q1996_C1	Yes either Shaffalah or the Yes either Shaffalah or the Learning Centre, both part of Qatar Foundation.  Aisha-Taweela
Q1996_C2	Check with Shaffalah and the Check with Shaffalah and the Learning Centre as noted above, but you may not find the same type of programs you are accustomed to in North America - not saying they're bad or anything, but different.  Conditions like Down's Syndrome exist here as they do everywhere in the world - however, often children are not seen - what I mean is, they're often kept at home, where they will be safe but exposure to the outside world is limited.    Not all parents do this of course, but whereas in North America I'm never surprised to see someone with a disability (whether physical, mental, or congenital) at the mall or the grocery store or the movies - it's unusual enough here for me to "notice" them on a conscious level.    This is merely an FYI in terms of adjusting to the local "culture" on this issue, another point is that many people from the subcontinent "stare" at people and things they consider to be different (hey, I'm one of them when I go out for a walk with the dog, I try to look at it as I'm a form of entertainment - half of the dog and pony show so to speak)it can be disconcerting especially when you first arrive.  I'm sure you and your family would be able to get along fine and I hope the programs on offer at these organizations will be useful.  Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"
Q1996_C3	Don't even think about it. Don't even think about it.  You might be able to get a place in a mainstream school provided you pay for a special needs assistant (untrained) for your son.  Don't come.
Q1996_C4	Compass takes special needs. Compass takes special needs.  I know of at least one family who has a Down's child there, although I have no idea of the severity.  I would contact them to see if they can help otherwise, as others have said, I wouldn't come to Doha.

Q2001_C15	We'll just have to We'll just have to wait..  Insha Allah.. it will be on Friday.. I don't want Ramadan to end so soon :(
Q2001_C16	Saeed pls read To begin with, al in Arabic means the and ilaah means God. In Arabic the denite article the is a part of the word and is not a separate part of it as in English, so when putting the two words together al and ilaah we get the word Allah or Allaah which mean the God.  The i, the rst letter of ilaah has been omitted to facilitate the pronunciation. Note that the l in Allaah is a dark one.  Now you must be wondering, what is the difference between the words Allaah and Allah, its simply a matter of spelling; the spelling Allah is more common, but in I-MAG we adopt the spelling Allaah as it represents the true pronunciation of the word in standard Arabic.  It is note worthy that there are two pronunciations of the word, one is a colloquial one to which the spelling Allah might be more suitable, and a standard and more correct pronunciation that the spelling Allaah best represent.

Q2003	Can I buy a car instead of renting? Hello everybody,  I will come to work in Qatar for 1 year next month. I got a visit visa - one entry for one month and my company will renew it every month. So my question is: Can I buy a used car instead of renting? Thank you in advance
Q2003_C1	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? I understand you will not have a residency permit...RP that is...without that you cant open a bank account...the only way you can buy a used or a brand new car is to pay for it in cash since you wont be able to get a bank loan for that  Good luck
Q2003_C2	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? If you DO get a residency permit, then you can open a bank account.  If you're goingto need an auto loan, the bank will only loan you money if your company or sponsor is on the "approved list".  If you're not on their approved list, you're not out of luck because Mashreq Bank and Al Khaliji Bank will loan you money even if you're not on the list.  This is assuming you have a very good salary and some documentation to prove it.  good luck!
Q2003_C3	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? But will he even be able to get a driver's license without the RP?  From what I understand you can drive for a week or two with some countries' drivers' licenses but not longer.  So he wouldn't be able to either rent or buy (register) the car.  Also, it's illegal to work on a visit visa isn't it?  Subject to arrest and deportation if caught?
Q2003_C4	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? I have a friend that is trying to do the same as you. Renting is expensive and if you buy a decent secondhand car you will have something to sell at the end of 12 months. My friend is here for 2 or 3 weeks every month and has been using a driver or renting a jeep at approximatley 5000-6000 Qatar Rials per month. I think you will need to get an International License or a short term Qatar license every time you renew you visa. I think about 200 Rials but not sure  The problem is ownership of the car, you will need to register the car and also get insurance. I am not sure about these details.  Please if you find out any helpful details please contact me 6730727
Q2003_C5	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? I hope this doesn't end up being a duplicate because I don't yet see the 2nd answer I just submitted.  Anyway, first of all, a car rental agency will rent you a car if you don't have a Qatari DL.  However, you will not be covered under any insurance umbrella.  Meaning, if you get into an accident you're 100% responsible for all repairs to the car up to the full prie of the car (unless it's deemed the other drivers fault). Yes, it's technically illegal to work on a tourist or visit visa, but some companies will let you slide if you're in the process of applying for an RP. You won't be able to buy and register a vehicle without an RP if you're trying for a bank loan.  You won't even be able to open an account.  banks won't lend money to anyone unless yuo're on their "approved list".  However, Mashreq Bank and Al Khaliji will give you a loan if yuo're not on the list provided you have a good income and can put 10% down.  Even if you pay cash, I don't think you can register or insure a new/used car without an RP.
Q2003_C6	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? I understand your position very well, but remember you CANNOT process anything without a Residence Permit (RP). When I say anything I mean it - Bank Account, Driver's Licence, Vehicle Registration, etc.   Talk to your company and try to get a work permit and then an RP. Failing which ask the company for an allowance for a regular taxi. There are many individuals providing personal taxi services - although there are measures to ban this practice.  Once again remember without an RP you cannot process anything in Qatar. And if you meet with an accident while driving without an RP the Police ot the other party will simply put the blame on you.
Q2003_C7	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? why don't you request then with your company to provide you one... otherwise I would suggest that you should rent to avoid problem in future.
Q2003_C8	RE: Can I buy a car instead of renting? Yes u can buy by cheap price i have a car i want to sell it now it's Maxima Nissan 98 model u can come and see if u want call me 5173177

Q2022	Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? My wife is 38 weeks pregnent and has been going to hamad Hospital since last 3 months.In hamad hospital doctors recommend an ultrasound after every 2 weeks.Can any one tell me that is it harmful for the baby? In India generally doctors do not prefer this much frequent ultrasound checkups.Please suggest and share your experience.
Q2022_C1	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? as far as i know ultrasounds are not harmful as they use sound waves to see the baby and not radiation.  my wife had one with almost every visit (we were in doha) but not every two weeks.  but at least every month, some months more because we went to get second opinions.
Q2022_C2	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? I am following up with Hamad hospital for 3 months and I am almost 21 weeks. Usually they do the ultra sound once a month until the 32 -34 weeks when they start to do it every 2 weeks in order to make sure the mother and baby are healthy and knowing when the labor will start.  I have asked that question and they ultra sound technician said that, if the pregnant lady did the ultra sound over 25 times during her first trimester it will be harmful for the baby. because the first trimester is when the development of the baby and his/her organs are developing.  by the end of second trimester to the end of the third is only gain of weight and size.  hope this helps    www.bastook.com
Q2022_C3	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? no,at diagnostic level that too at later period of pregnancy it is safe.It is better to follow Hamad Hosp suggestion
Q2022_C4	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? There is no harm in doing frequent Ultra sound test
Q2022_C5	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? u said she is in her 38 months so she is about to have the baby any time now .so it it is normal to check on the baby freqently.nothing wrong with that .
Q2022_C6	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? Thanks to all of you.Your answers have really made me feel better because this is our first baby and I was a little worried about that. Once again thanks a lot........
Q2022_C7	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? The less frequent the better.  I had ultrasound every 2 weeks in my 1st trimester when i was expecting my youngest son.  It is not recommended but I had a complicated pregnancy that was why.  My son now 3,5 years old, healthy and happy .. Thank God. eventhough I had the same worries you had.  So, have a wonderfull parenthood.
Q2022_C8	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? I had ultrasound done every month when I was pregnant(that was during the time when I went to private clinic)then I switched to Hamad Hospital and I had three more in the last trimester of pregnancy.No complications just to make sure everything was ok with my baby.
Q2022_C9	RE: Is Ultrasound Sonography is harmful for the baby? At the begining stage of preganancy you have to go for ultrasound each and every (03) months, to make sure your baby is healthy and safe, if any complecation occured found by the Doctor, they recommend for Frequent Ultrasound which is necessary.....  - Naeem -

Q2034	Mom, Do you know Israel? My 8-yr. old son went up to me and asked "Mom, do you know Israel?" I said yes and asked him why'd you ask... He answered and said "My classmate said that Israel kills the babies in Lebanon."   As a parent, how will you handle this? I know Israel is a big and delicate issue in Middle East...

Q2034_C3	kids will be kids, but its kids will be kids, but its grown up's who needs to be more responsible.  My daughter goes to one of the leading International school in Doha, where Muslim children are in minority.  When she told her friends about her trip to Saudi Arab in spring break, one of the kids told her not to go because the ppl are bad there.  she took the matter to the teacher and he confirmed it for her by saying yes there are bad ppl in Saudi.  Now as a teacher, it beats me how he could be so irresponsible.  A grown up should not feed these hate thoughts to children.  So I had to explain me 7 yr old how there are good and bad in every part of the world, and every religion, we just avoid bad ones and stick with good ones.    I thought raising children in mulsim country will be eaiser for me, but i guess raising kids is not easy no matter where you are.
Q2034_C4	I'd explain both sides- and I'd explain both sides- and that neither are right. It's an opportunity to help teach him possibly about how to draw his own conclusions, when presented with all sides of an issue. I remember vividly my parents doing the same with me when it came to nuclear weapons (I was the only five year old who could tell you what Hiroshima was and why it was bad- hippy parents), the situation in Rwanda in 1994, apartheid, etc etc. THe fact is this country DOES have a huge slant, and i think it's important for anyone, kid or adult, to think critically about things.
Q2034_C5	aLSO, it might be a good aLSO, it might be a good time to explain judaism anyway- it's Purim season and that's a fun jewish holiday :) I mean, you can't avoid learning about Islam here, may as well slot in the other religions too!

Q2034_C7	I take my hats off to you I take my hats off to you UMM!
Q2034_C8	qatarisun While agreeing in totality with your first post tell him when there is a war, everybody kills everybody. Tell him the WAR is BAD! tell him everyone should live in peace I disagree with the second one.  When there is a war people are killed. The bullet fired does not take care that victim belongs to which religion. I cant stress more. But let me tell you that I believe in taking consideration of roots problem rather than just consequences thereof.  Zionist Israel is responsible for the present crisis thats all! And if you kill someone expect same reaction from other end.
Q2034_C9	Advocate when you were at Advocate when you were at school did you ever have to do a debate on a subject you didn't like?   I think it is good if schools do this as it forces you to look at other peoples values, and just because you think they are silly, etc they are still their values and how you can more effectively have a dialogue.
Q2034_C10	this happened with me, too -- My son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that Israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them...got him really wound up and scared.  So I explained to him that the other kids were Muslim, and they they believed certain things that we didn't necessarily believe in.  They don't they don't eat pork, we do; we believe in Santa, they don't; etc.   I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it's never nice, but it happens.  And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can, but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident.  It's sad but it happens.  And then I explained that some of our best family friends are Jewish and/or Israelis, and I asked if he knew that (no, he didn't), and then I said that I didn't think that our friends were bad people at all (he agreed), and so I didn't think it was fair for people to say that ALL Israelis were bad.  That there were good and bad people everywhere, all over the world.  He kind of got the idea...  But it IS tough raising kids here...and I know I am going to have to constantly fight this battle, because he will hear it from kids every single year -- on the playground, in class, everywhere.  BTW, we had to do this song-and-dance on another controversial issue: homosexuality.  My son came home one day and announced that when a man loves another man and gets married to him, it's "haram" (LOL -- he didn't even know what that word meant!).  So off I went on my soapbox, trying to explain to him MY point of view that there is nothing wrong with any two adults who love one another...and that when he grows up, he can decide for himself what he thinks is right and wrong about a lot of things.  And that in the meantime, he will hear a lot of different ideas, but that doesn't necessarily make any of them correct or mean that he has to agree with them, even with ideas that I subscribe to.  Whew!  It's tough being a parent!!
Q2034_C11	@grand.. wouldn't that be biased?
Q2034_C12	it is difficult but I do like the way Umm handled it.  I have a friend, she is from England her husband from Lebanon.  Her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in NO WAY was he going to have anything to do with Lebanon because his friends did not like Arabs.   This boys goes to one of the 'supposed' best schools in Doha.  I told my friend, that if that was my kid, they would have gone to school with a Cedar strapped to their hand, some Lebanese food and Union Jack underpants.    My thoughts are my own, but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.
Q2034_C13	to ummjake.. that was nice... i admire you that you have shown your son the two other sides of the coin...yes, it's really tough raising our kids here..
Q2034_C14	thats wonderful because a thats wonderful because a young child's mind needs to be moulded into a proper one and the circumstances and environment he lives in is a major factor in that. I would make sure that he remains as neutral as possible and when he grows up, then he can take sides
Q2034_C15	I think I might try to I think I might try to defuse the specifics of the question and focus on "what is war." Explain why war is wrong and use the example of children being killed as a reason why we must all work to bring about peace. That way you don't have to take sides in a we/they, Israel/Lebanon discussion at this point.  Mandi

Q2034_C20	base, you could simply base, you could simply explain that there are bad people in the world everywhere, not only in Israel.(for parents, i think, this is perhaps the saddest realization you could get-- that your child will be growing up in a world so screwed and f up that humans are treated like s*t in some parts of the world) truly sad indeed. btw, base make sure you know the school of your child and its environment. it would help if you placed here in a tolerant environment.  mo lang!
Q2034_C21	You have to tell your You have to tell your kid: Never never blame the people and the country. The war - it's political issues and government responsibilities. Jewish people are kind, religious and the most educated people in the world. They don't kill babies. The government does. One government provokes, the other replies.  NEVER NEVER teach you kids to hate JUST PEOPLE!!!

Q2034_C26	I agree with UMMJAKE I think that politicians on both sides are responsible for civilian victims on both sides. I can't deceive myself and others by blaming Israel only because I am a muslim or an arab
Q2034_C27	I am amazed by your reply ummjake, I am really surprised by your arguments trying to explain to your son things that he knows better than you. While I would pass on the Israeli vs Arab (Muslim) issue because it is contravertial, and I don't want to be biase, I am stunned by your answers/arguments about Gays. Your son has the correct info, and I am certain you know that as well. Just your freek education and being politically correct prevent you from saying the truth. If you are a christian or a Jewsih, you know that the bible or old testement do not approve of this. If you don't have a religion, you know that human nature does reject such a relationship.   Your kid is being tought the correct things at school, while you are manipulating them....
Q2034_C28	okabbar...to each his own... Why does it bother you (or anyone else really) what two consenting adults choose to do with their private romantic/sexual lives?  They're not asking you to join in.  Just be happy they have found someone to love and care for.  And human nature does not reject such a relationships.  Statistics show that 10% of the population are homosexual.  There's even evidence of homosexuality being the norm in some parts of the animal kingdom. Do your homework...   My kid isn't being taught this in school.  Trust me.  If he were, I would yank him out of there so fast your head would spin.  He's hearing about it from the other kids in the neighborhood, who hear it from their parents, who subscribe to that notion because their religion dictates it and that's what they've been brought up on.  If that lifestyle is not for you, then don't follow it.  Simple enough.  Let everyone make their own choices about what works for them.   Think you can handle that?
Q2034_C29	We have been created to Multiply First, thank you for taking the debate with a good spirit. By the way, currently, I live in US, and probably moving to Qatar inthe next 2-months or so. The two of us and the lady who started this thread are going through the same thing in a different spirit. While I am trying to move to Qatar to protect my kids form the type of education and tolerance the west promot (and obviously you do as well), you are trying to protect your kids from the good morals that the society in QA breatch.   I am an educated person with a PhD degree, and very open to tolerate many issues, but nothing againist the human nature or the order of God. While I was so accomodating to avoid the debate about Israel (I am an arab by the way), I would not tolerate the Gays Lesbian issue.   Good created us to Multiply, otherwise, if two men get married and two women get married, and the human raise will disappear. It is immoral issue, and disgusting behaviour.   It is not a matter of why I am bothered by this, it is a matter of moral and religion belive. The three main relgion do disapprove of this. You know the story of the people of prophet Loat (sp!), how good punished them. The story is mentioned in the three holy books.  I would certainly argue againist the animal kingdoom? I have never read, heard, or seen that animals do practice this. Males animals always fight for feamales.   Any culture and society has positives and negatives, and the smart person who try to improve on his qualities. I have been in NA for 18 years, and picked up many of the good qualities that are hear, such as educations, work ethics, honesty, dedications, tolearnce, objectivity, being profissional in all aspect of your life, time keeping, etc. I hope you can be prave enough, and pick on some of the good ethics and morals down there in Qatar, beside the money....
Q2034_C30	okabbar you'll probably encounter gays in Doha more than any other place.
Q2034_C31	very articulate ummjake Well expressed, Ummjake. If my son came home spouting stuff about homosexuality being 'haram' I would certainly object to it strongly too.   The fact of homosexuality being found in the animal kingdom is indeed well documented. There are cases of 'gay' animals being found in some colonies. It is (humourously) called the 'science that dares not speak its name'. I do recall an interesting documentary on Showtime (the Arab world satellite network) about this not long ago.  What this fact of nature indicates that it is not the 'unnatural' behaviour moralists have always claimed it to be, since given a free reign, even animals engage in it naturally. Human - and animal - sexuality is so much more complex than just the 'man and woman.. they make baby' narrative which religionists are have been using for centuries.  And homosexuality being condemned in the Christianity and Judaism? Hmm, you may want to check your facts on that one. Sure, the Vatican don't like it, but there is a lot of scholarship to explain why the anti-gay interpretation gained traction over history - gained traction until it was considered a "fact" - but was, in fact, not correct.  Understanding the nature of religion as a way of leveraging power over others really helps to explain why we follow its rituals and ideas with such dedication, even flying in the face of logic, science, or reason.   ------------- "let's slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini" Mae West
Q2034_C32	Gays... Gays,,, Gays..thats all i hear... Only a man knows what a man needs....fly the flag boys. you use my pole any day..
Q2034_C33	Although i respect ummjack Although i respect ummjack opinion. But i would never teach my son to accept gays. i'll never teach him either to fear or reject them. It's up to him to determine it himself.  Both my parents share "arab nationalist" ideology.Yet, I've never been taught to hate jews.
Q2034_C34	with my children I always, always say there are good and bad in every race, religion and country.   Respect has to be given to all. I am very old fashioned, my boys always stand up when ANY lady enters the room. They hold doors open for both men and women, simply because that shows respect and good manners to an adult.   If an adult is rude to them after they have shown them respect, all I say is, they could have been having a bad day (whilst fuming).    My thoughts are my own, but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.
Q2034_C35	Knowledge an article you may find informative. Written by the same journalist who so vehemently argued against the recent attempt to ban criticism of religions in the UN; I only mention this as it further points out that nothing should be free from scrutiny and criticism  - otherwise the carnage in Gaza could also be suppressed.     http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-dupes-no-we-were-telling-the-truth-1649528.html  <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Deaths in the Bible.

Q2034_C36	Jack I never do Always have a variety of sources, weigh the evidence, it's authenticity and provenience then make up my own mind.  <span style="font-style: italic">&quot;Deaths in the Bible. God - 2,270,365 not including the victims of Noah's flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, or the many plagues, famines, fiery serpents, etc because no specific numbers were given. Satan - 10.&quot;</span
Q2034_C37	Jack I too agree that what read in the press or see on the 'news' has to be taken with a pinch of salt.  However, how do people learn?  I admit that people are travelling more and so they see for themselves but we have to read and then debate and then make our own conclusions.      My thoughts are my own, but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.
Q2034_C38	Israel Thanks all for a high quality debate.  I think we can both learn from hearing the other side.  I want to take up for the Israel argument from the perspective of another Arab (in this case Palestinian) who has lived over half his life in the US and England.  Its true that in the middle east there is a culture of black and white.  However, in the west, there is a CULTURE OF GRAY.  In other words, there is a tendency to say both sides are at fault and there is no hard facts and no right and wrong.  Sometimes this is true, but in my opinion often it allows one to have a lazy psuedo-intellectual opinion about a subject they know very little about.  It takes knowledge to take a (fair) stand.  There is little remaining grayness in the Israel Palestine issue.  This is a situation where one people came and displaced another, and continue to abuse them for over 50 years.    Israeli historians and most Israeli intellectuals agree with these facts.  Look up Benny Morris and the new historians in Israel for the modern scholarly Israeli narrative for what happened in Palestine.  Its not pretty.  Israel is in defiance of nearly 100 UN resolutions, relating both to their land grab and human rights records.   The closest analogy is the displacement of the native indians in north america -- I am sure it would sound shocking if you try to assign them some of the blame for the genocide they experienced.    The other side tries to feebly resist, but are subjected to an overwhelming opression and injustice; the closest anology to the current situation on the ground is aparthide in south africa.    Nowadays, the Arab countries have made remarkable compromise articulated in the Saudi initiative more than 5 years ago.  They are agreeing to complete normalization with Israel, in exchange for the west bank (21% of the area of the historical Palestine which had less than 5% jews 100 years ago).   However, Israeli right wing, with the support of the Israeli lobbies the US (AIPAC and JDL and their cronies) insist on no compromise.    Meanwhile, over 2 million Palestinians continue to live in subhuman conditions and the world continues to find "both sides at blame" because they will not agree to it.  We live in strange times.  I hope that you would instead encourage your kids to read and figure out the facts; isnt that a great lesson?  I am a strong believer that with justice, comes peace, and the festering wounds that generate hate are dried up.  I also sincerely hope that you invest a little more energy into learning about the middle east geo-political issues before assuming that you know about it than the people living it do.
Q2034_C39	joi_de_vivre it's not about the conflict.. the question was: how to handle the question of 8 years-old boy about "israelians killing Lebanese babies". You suggest studding israelian-palestin conflict and figuring out who is 'good' and who is 'bad', which consequentially leads to accepting one side and judging another, which eventually leads to the stirring up the hatred. But thats NOT what the child needs.  NOT to find out who is right and who is wrong, NOT to argue anymore when, who, and why? Child needs to be explained that ANY killing is bad, ANY war is wrong. Child doesnt need to understand WHY one kills another.  Child has to learn: any KILLING shouldnt be accepted in the civil world.  I hope you can see the difference.  <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2034_C40	I completely agree and see I completely agree and see the difference.  I was not offering any advice about how to handle the situation of the original poster.  I struggle with these issues with my own sons, who are 5 and 3.    I was attempting to generate an ADULT discussion similar to the one above on homosexuality.  Cheers.
Q2034_C41	Joi_de_vivre: but honestly, what parent is going to NOT tell their kids something they believe is true "because it has not been well-researched"? (And who is deciding whether something is well-researched or not?)  Nobody would do that.  I think the most open-minded of parents might try to explain both sides and then tell their kids that as they grow up and learn more, they will make up their own minds, but we will almost always explain what WE believe is true....because when you believe something yourself, you generally think that you are right.  That's just human nature.  I seriously doubt that the religious among us would tell their kids "Well, mommy and I believe in one God, and that he created the heavens and the earth.  But that's just us.  You should read up on the subject and find out what makes sense to you."  LOL!  But wouldn't it be fun if they did?
Q2034_C42	ummjake... Kudos to you for teaching your children that what is taught and said in school isn't the gospel truth! Children are confused enough as it is in life without being taught that certain nationalities, races, religions, sexual orientation, are the devil incarnate. Children's minds are like blank blackboards...they also absorb things like sponges. Why teach them hatred against others at such a young impressionable age when all they want to do is be friends with the next child, irregardless of who or where they are from?  Life is difficult enough to deal with, without presetting young minds upon a destructive path.    If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-
Q2034_C43	??? If I am from the USA then I should have the same opinion as you?  I say clearly I am a Palestinian who has lived in the US over half his life.  I am a US citizen.  I am a long term lurker on qatarliving who registered to contribute to this conversation.  I am a Professor in a US university on sabbatical leave for the year in Qatar--what does this have to do with anything, anyways?  My response was intended to generate adult conversation.  The crux of my argument is that many expats here do not understand the geopolitical situation in Israel/Palestine and assume instead that people here are irrational for having the opinion that they do about Israel.  A peaceful and just resolution to the problem there is the only way to stop the hate; that starts with understanding the facts on the ground, instead of having the PC opinion that there are no facts and everyone there is equally to blame. My response was not intended in any way to be something you say to your kids--poor choice of thread on my part.
Q2034_C44	ummjake I completely agree with your sentiment and respect the way you are raising your kids.  I apologize if my response came across as if I am being critical of you. I like the emphasis on growing up and learning more for issues that are too complex for them to handle; I will use that line with my own kids if you dont mind.  Peace (and justice!)
Q2034_C45	Joi_de_vivre, I took no offense at your postings and have no problem with your nationality, heritage or where you choose to live or work.  I agree -- a lot of these issues present wonderful teaching moments if you've got kids.  But as parents we have to view them as such and be mindful of what we say, how we say it, and whether our actions match our words...   As Robert Fulghum said, "Don't worry that children never listen to you; worry that they are always watching you."
Q2034_C46	Okabbar, welcome to Doha if Okabbar, welcome to Doha if indeed you decide to come. There is a lot of benefit to raising children here, especially kids from North America who have tended to see themselves as the center of the known universe! But one caveat for you, I have known many parents with fine moral fiber get the shock of their lives when they tumble to the fact that their kids are mistreating their maids, shopkeepers or other laborers whom they happen to come in contact with. I'm not saying everyone and I know that every parent says not my kid, but I've known a lot of surprised and dismayed parents.  Mandi

Q2034_C49	Thanks Mandilulur Thanks for the greetings. I don't know how much you know about Canada and its culture and education. Canada and Canadian system is one of a kind when it comes to social integration, respecting others, and peaceful interactions. To make the story short, I have three boys (10, 7, and 2), and they are so respectable to others and so peaceful. To a a degree, where I am a bit annoyed about it. I am struggling to teach my kids to be aggressive when there is a need for it. They always resort to peaceful ways in resovling any conflicts or aggression committed against them at school. The are so obedient to rules and polices. I want them to be street wise, and when things turns rough, they can handle it.  So may be they will gain some of this by moving to Doha!! I hope you understand my point, I am not an agressive or agressor, but boys (future men) they need to be tought to stand up for themselves if there is a need for it.  US culture is totally different, and it is more in the aggressive side compared to Canada. Currently I work in US (since June 08), but I did not move my family yet. I am in a cross road, where I need to decide once and for all if I am going to move to Arabic country or settle for ever in NA. Giving my kids the opportunity to be fluent in arabic and experince Islamic/Arabic culture and true religious feastivities have been playing in my mind for few years. It is vefry difficult to hear my kids speek arabic in a funny way/tone.
Q2034_C50	I guess the Wooo... I guess the political and religious threads are the strongest magnets in this community.  My answer to the original question...I would tell my child that she can't hate a group of people based on what "some" of them do...if your colleague at school is nice to you...be more nice to her/him regardless of what her nationality or regligion is. If she buys you a gift on your birthday...be sure to save her birthday date on your calender and don't forget to buy her a great gift.  Do not hate anyone unless you try and try and try and try to communicate your hurt to them...tell them why you feel hurt by what they do and why their actions are keeping you from loving them.  War is an ugly thing. No baby deserves to die in return for a woman who got killed by a bomber...and vice versa. In the end, different people are influenced by the cultures they are raised in...and from these cultures they conclude their own opinions about different topics in life...war,sex,education,work,religion...etc.  The best thing to do is to try to strip your mind off any biased ideas and prejedice against any group of people.  Jews and Israelis are very much unwelcommed and hated in the middle east...because people hear and see everyday from the media what Israelis do to their brothers and sisters.  In the western communities....muslims are also unwelcommed and hated...because people there see and hear from the media what muslims do around the world.  If you stand up for something...you will have to prove you are right...and you will have to suffer the consequences and responsibilities for your beleifes.  In the end...I would tell my daughter to refer to the Quran...it explain best all what I'have just said.

Q2037_C7	crying is a natural reaction... a natural defense mechanism of the human body regardless of sex (male or female)...  although most men and women as well, thought of crying as a sign of weakness. saying "only ladies cry."  but for me a man who cries is a man who knows himself throughly...he understands very well that crying is a natural reaction..and doing such can not or will never diminish his sexuality or manliness. he only wants to feel better after every crying...thus affirming his humanity.   by the way, animals don't cry...they go on rage.   =========================== When in Rome do as the Romans do!!!

Q2037_C11	Tears have healing powers... it's okay to cry...Real men should not be afraid to cry...Men who cry are confident with themselves that they are true men who are brave to accept their weakness...who understand that breaking down or crying is not a sign of being sissies rather it is a natural human emotion that everyone has to go through.  i have read somewhere that the percentage of breakdowns/ suicides are higher in males than females...females have the capacity to handle problems/situations because aside from friends and families who give them moral support, their tears give way to bottled up emotions...once they have a good cry, they feel better and relieved.

CRV - QAR.100,000/-) on a 5 year loan @ 5%; add 2.5% - 3% Processing fee + 25% interest + first year insurance say 5% ... your total to pay bank is 100,000+2500+25000+5000 i.e., 132,000 therefore monthly instalment would be 132,000/60 = QAR.2,208/- and it could vary slightly depending on the grace period you choose or bank offers for the first repayment.  You can get the same terms from car dealer's inhouse financing (if bankloan doesnt work) but the rate could be 7.5-8.5%   Good luck
Q2050_C4	cant he just pickup a phone cant he just pickup a phone and call the relevant agencies and get the rates? That wouldnt take up much time isnt it?
Q2050_C5	Thanks xpress thanks express for the info.... so just in case i am changing my job b4 5ys, do i need 2 pay the entire amount to the bank b4 joining a new company???
Q2050_C6	Car loan if you move company... No, you can change jobs within qatar, your new company will provide a letter so you can keep the loan at repayment agreed originally.  I am leaving Qatar soon and am going to transfer the bank loan I have for my car to the next buyer as long as they are eligable for the loan. You can do this no problem.  I have a Toureg V8 if you are interested :)

Q2053	Is any  legal problem for driving the car of other person I heard there is rule in Qatar one person cannot drive the car of other person ( other than his sponsor). is it true? pls let me know  thanks in advance
Q2053_C1	RE: Is any  legal problem for driving the car of other... no problem at all...you just have to present an ownership id if and when the police requires you to do so...just be safe and prevent accidents
Q2053_C2	RE: Is any  legal problem for driving the car of other... I too am interested in this. If my friend lends me his car and I have a valid licence, does his car insurance automatically cover me to drive? In the UK cars are insured under the name of the driver and if you want anyone else to drive it you have to put their name on the policy. Is that the same here?
Q2053_C3	RE: Is any  legal problem for driving the car of other... As far as I understand it, it is the car that is insured not the driver. so as long as you have a valid driving licence, Qatari or otherwise you are insured to drive the vehicle.
Q2053_C4	RE: Is any  legal problem for driving the car of other... YES, no problem you can drive other people's car anytime as long as you did not hit something or worst someone.  Cheers,

Q2054_C11	Yes you need something with a Yes you need something with a close sea view. You should try al Sharq. I think it is very romantic. They give you those rooms like little homes, nice sea view and great pools..  If you want to party, it is not the place.  W is my fav in terms of service, but it does not fall under the romantic category.  4 seasons sucks. Looks good from far but is far from good. Grand Hayat is OK, it's got a bit of everything you might need. I'd still go to Sharq if I am to impress someone and be super romantic tho.
Q2054_C12	Try Fraser Suites Hotel This hotel just opened last sept..you can take a romantic walk down corniche after your dinner.

Q2056_C6	RE: Can I leave Qatar without ID better ask the authorities. a friend of mine was issued a residence permit about 3 weeks back, he has the ID, and he got exit permit from his company. all was set for a planned trip to dubai, but, was he aghast when the airline would not let him board. apparently your visa needs to be at least 6 months old before you are granted exit. well, at least to GCC, though im not very sure, perhaps to home country is fine. but otherwise, i think you're in detention.  should be worth it to check with the right people just to save you the hassle.

But be aware that this will only give you a video signal, no audio.

Q2089_C2	RE: GCC Driving License You can't drive in Egypt with your Qatari Driving Liciense. You need to first get an International Driving License here in Qatar and then you can drive there in Egypt with your International Driving License.
Q2089_C3	RE: GCC Driving License You cannot drive in Egypt with your Qatari D/L, You must obtain Egyptian D/L first. Have a nice journey
Q2089_C4	RE: GCC Driving License I beleive you can still take a Interntaional Drivers Lic ense from Qatar for the time being.. :)
Q2089_C5	RE: GCC Driving License Qatar Driving License  General Qatari residents must carry a valid Qatari driving licence. GGC State Nationals are permitted to use their National Driving Licenses. As a visitor (other nationals) to Qatar, your national driving licence is acceptable for seven days from your date of arrival in the country. If you wish to rent a car for longer than the seven days (but do not intend to take up permanent residence) you will require a temporary driving license.   If you are keen to drive during your first few months in Qatar, it is worth obtaining an International Licence before you get here. An International Driving License is valid for 6 months from the date of your arrival in Qatar.  Getting a driving license depends on what country you are from. Citizens from most western countries such as Canada and the U.K. can change their drving licenses for Qatari ones. Other nationalities have to do a driving test which is actually quite difficult. In most cases the procedure for issuing a local licence just includes an eye test and a simple written test. However, it is necessary to hold a residence permit in order to apply for a Qatari driving licence.     The Procedure Temporary Driving License  The following items are required for a Temporary Driver's license (TDL):  a) Original drivers license from home country.   b) Eye examination.   c) Process fees QR156 (about $45).   d) Four personal photos (with eye glasses, if required).   e) Copy of Passport  An appointment for the eye examination will be set up for you by the HR Department and you will be informed of the time and date for the appointment.  Permanent Drivers License  Converting the Temporary Driver's License to a Permanent Driver's License requires the following:  a) Temporary Drivers License (TDL).   b) Two photos.   c) Copy of Passport and Residence Permit.   d) Process fees of QR156 (about $45).

Q2095_C4	RE: 90% White Cars...???? 1. Agreed that White reflects heat, but I doubt that it will do much effect on the car as the body is metal and its a conductor.  2. Dust doesn't show much on a white car.  3. Easier to touch up white than any other shade of a color.  4. It has evolved into a choice now.  People just go for white cars! I went to one showroom once and they said they order for 50% white cars and the rest 50% other colors.

Q2096	Trekking equipment Hi, I am planning a hiking trip in the himalayas for next month. Is there any shop in Doha where I can suitable trekking gear (e.g. winter sleeping bag, fleece, trekking pants,ect.)? Regards
Q2096_C1	karni sleeping bags that you buy here wont work there coz its winter season in the himalayan region and you need small, and light sleeping bags that can withstand temperatures upto -10 degree celcius or more.
Q2096_C2	I bought a back pack from I bought a back pack from Souq Asiri for 180 riyals. Held everything that I needed. Bought a sleeping bag from City Centre for 65QR and the moment I used it, I started regretting my decision. I was still dead freezing.  I am paralysed from one lower limb, so I had to carry what I was able to carry and most of the time the stuff I took with me thinking that I might need it sometime later on was not even used. So the next time I go, I will just take myself and some extra cash with me as everything is available wherever you go. I went to Pakistan to the Karakoram and crossed over to China. The best trip of my life and I will be going back again. Visit Hunza in Pakistan and Karakul Lake in China when you go there and make your way to east to Tibet. Its amazing.
Q2096_C3	You can try Sport shops at City center I do not remember the name exactly but there is a shop at 3rd floor I think. You can find pants, bags, shoes and such stuff there. They sell nice stuff like Columbia, Titanium, etc.. but its hard to find sizes sometimes. The shop is beside Timberland.  "What doesn't kill me; makes me stronger..."
Q2096_C4	I doubt you will find what I doubt you will find what are you looking for.  Sleeping bags are available but you might need to have at least 3 season for winter hike. Trekking sticks and some good stuff is available in the new sports shop in Villagio, near food courts. Expensive shop but some good stuff is there.  If you are not able to find good clothing, go with the layers. The best thing (if you can find) is breathable wind breaker/rain jacket.

Q2098_C10	Thanks fRanCisM and Thanks fRanCisM and CHEF_MACKY for your help.   Sorry I did not response for the past week bec. I ready myself for the OD.
Q2098_C11	HR is not just HR. It is a HR is not just HR. It is a strategy.   Apply, and keep on applying. Do not be disappointed by rejection, they look for specific characters. It is very likely they will reject you 2 to 3 times before even considering you.   When going, dress business. Dress like a hostess, make-up and the whole ten yards.   Speech, take a part-time job in a call center. They will teach you how to speak English, and in due time you'll loose your accent (if you have one).    Lastly, do not focus on one airliner only.   Good luck.
Q2098_C12	Yeah Dude was right, Yeah Dude was right, character is the main factor in your field, just recently 1 crew was commended for a WOW service. Develop your character, you will not only present our country but the Qatar as well, when you'll become part of the their team, remember you will be dealing with various kinds of nationalities.

Q2103	Resale of a Kia versus Nissan Thanks for earlier responses. Does a Nissan have better resale than Kia?
Q2103_C1	RE: Resale of a Kia versus Nissan yap nissan sunny 2001 price 19000Qr
Q2103_C2	RE: Resale of a Kia versus Nissan Yes, you are right !! Nissan have better resale than Kia
Q2103_C3	RE: Resale of a Kia versus Nissan Well, i would go for neither of them, as both of those companies have low resale values. It is true that Nissan has higher resale value than Kia, but both of them have low. As someone said, that a car doesn't matter as long as you like it, but you also need to look after the resale value. The two companies with the highest resale value are Honda and Toyota. I would recommend these 2 out of all.
Q2104	FYI, Philippine Passport Renewal To all my Kababayan who wants to renew their passport, there's no need to bring your Photograph. They will take a digital photo on the spot at a total amount of QR 240, quite expensive but what to do?

Q2104_C2	err.. yeah,even for photo copying,u have to pay for it too.
Q2104_C3	thanks for clearing that thanks for clearing that up... so it's including the renewal fee... would've been outrageous if it was for the photo alone... now that would be a total rip-off! :P
Q2104_C4	is this the electronic or the machine-readable passport?
Q2104_C5	It's e-passport, McGee, the MRP before is 200 QAR for renewal but you need to provide your own photos.  With e-Passport, the photo is digitally taken at the embassy itself and they added 40 QAR so now, it's 240 QAR.  But before going to the embassy, better to have your old passport photocopied as photocopying there is a bit more expensive than outside. Lol!
Q2104_C6	Sorry to confused you, Qr 240 Sorry to confused you, Qr 240 includes the renewal fee and digital photo.

Q2114	GPS of IPHONE 3GS hello everybody, i just want to ask something about iphone 3gs...does the gps working properly here in doha qatar?? theres any problem about iphone 3gs GPS??   im waiting for your response thanks guyzzz
Q2114_C1	the gps should be able to the gps should be able to give ur position almost properly but dont rely on the maps cause the maps aren't updated usually..  beta be careful otherwise u will land up on some closed road if u are following gps :P
Q2114_C2	try this app. Sygic.. google try this app. Sygic.. Google it.. or youtube it..
Q2114_C3	GPS GPS works exceptionally well in Desert countries like the Gulf as there is very less tree cover. Desert Storm was a GPS war...lol  You cannot lose your way even in low visiblity times like sand stroms etc.  While in places with very dense tree cover ,GPS signal is interrupted....its definitely a problem in Kerala....because of so much Coconut and other tree cover. GPS war would prove ineffective there...lol  Most of the phones have 2 modes of connection: 1. Assisted GPS  Will use cell site to connect, quick connect, but it has charges. This is usless in places where there is no cell-site like sealine...etc. I suggest to switch it off unless you literally cannot get a GPS signal even after 15minutes.  2. Integrated GPS Uses the true satellite signal to connect. It takes about 1 to 3 minutes to find a minimum of 3 satellites, depending on where you stand. It cannot function without reaching 3 or 4 satellites.  Advantages of Phones over stand alone SAT NAV units are: 1. You carry the phone everywhere ....chances of forgeting it are next to zero. 2. You can send your coordinates as MMS so someone comming to meet you in a remote place....say you are meeting a group in the desert. 3. Convenience...It has everything in a single unit....especially the camera. 4. Its dirt cheap if you split the cost as below:    (a)Phone, (b)Camera, (c) music/video player (d) camera      (e) GPS  <b>Best GPS Mobile is Samsung Omnia QR 1850</b> (Carrefour) 8GB card, 5MP camera, Excellent WIFI, due to Windows OS , Touch Screen, Garmin XT Mobile GPS software,

Q2114_C5	... I have an Iphone 3GS. Both the GPS and Maps are just fine. I can pinpoint my location even inside the office.
Q2114_C6	NEAHHH C'mon guys! Comment on something that is useful. @jailbroken114, for you it works perfectly because your're connected to your office's Wireless network, so the iphone can download the maps live from the net. Give it a try and go to Mesaeed in the desert and you will see that you will still have GPS (free all over the world - GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM)  signal but no map. So, how can you navigate back to safety during a sand storm for example. Nor QTEL or Vodafone offer  3G support for iPhone, hence you have no internet, hence you have no map. HENCE - You can't call that navigation, right?
Q2114_C7	Try the Iphone 3GS before you talk My experience is excellent using Cygic and Google Maps and the built in Maps app preloaded into the iphone.  Tried it and tested it to work perfectly with Cygic you don't need the internet connection. to pre register from my 1st hand experience.

Q2116	Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well? Kindergardens for expats? Is anyone looking strange at Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well? Kindergardens for expats kids available? Is anyone looking strange at you at shopping and on the street?Cheers.Mihai
Q2116_C1	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... It's safer than Australia for both men and women.  There are lots of kindergartens, just don't procrastinate finding one and getting acceptance.  And yes, be prepared to be stared at constantly.  Either just stare back or ignore it.
Q2116_C2	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS IS THE SAFEST PLACE AND VOID OF ANY PUBLIC INDECENCY AS IN DUBAI OR BAHARAIN.
Q2116_C3	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... don't worry, this is a safe country...being stared constantly is just a normal thing here. also, better to have a car when you're here than commuting...not only to avoid the stares but also the B.O of other passengers:( ewwwwww!!!!
Q2116_C4	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... Women stare just as much as men, particularly at Western people. Apart from the rudeness I encounter from other women occasionally, and the competition to have had the most babies, I don't find living here a problem.
Q2116_C5	RE: Hi there. Is it safe to work there? For women as well... It is safe but I was a working mum and I found these diffciulties....I had a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore I was left with maids who had company visas and or were illegal or not experienced but immediately looking foir the next jobs. I tested three but found none to satisfactory - my children were 2 and 4 so I kept them home as the fees for school a driver and the time the kids would have to get up were crazy I had a one hour commute each way so my days was wasted driving not with my kids. The nearest park to my home could be reached by car only, and the traffic sometimes made it a two hour exercise just in driving. The hospitals were OK but the public ones were accessible for appointments during work hours and the private ones expensive. I had a contract that allowed no unpaid leave and had penalties for missed work even if your kids were sick. Needless to say when my husabnd wanted to return home and resume his work and I had been unable to hire help and my son had an epileptic seizure - i gave notice and came home. As an expatriate worker with family I have found much friendly countries to work in where larger percentages of your pay stay with you and are not absorbed by high rents school fees and food prices. You need a good salary if you want to do all you want. in your contract get a vila provided and education for kids and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an OK expat lifestyle. It depends on your salary - a labourer might be conned into coming for 280 Riyal a month - god knows how they survive. I got 14,000 + and I decided I was better taking 40,000 aud per annum salary cut and working somewhere costs were cheaper and lifestyle more family friendly  I still don't have a job but I am very happy with my decision to prioritse my kids and leave Qatar for the Qataris- mostly I found people with families where the women or both parents worked less then satisfied with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kids - People on huge salaries who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kids spent every after schoool moment there seemed satisfied - live in a compound with play facilities and you may be OK . Good luck.

Q2118_C1	RE: How can I bring my family on Visit Visa if I do not... Try with your company if they can sponsor them until you get your RP..

Q2119	Sponsorshiip Transfer How may years does one need to continue with his first sponsor in Qatar before sponsorship can be transferred? The current sponsor provides NOC. Is the criteria 1 year or 2 years. Pls advise.Thanks
Q2119_C1	excuse me..... one year is enough for NAQL KAFALA (sponsorship change)
Q2119_C2	qatar malayali, you're excused...STILL WRONG Sponshorship change doesn't matter if its 1 or 2 years.   Coz if your current sponsor/employer won't give you an NOC (No Objection Certification), you can't change sponsorship...UNLESS it'll a transfer to a family/husband/wife visa.
Q2119_C3	Thank you for the input. I Thank you for the input. I have some clarity now. There were contradictory views when I checked; some said for the first transfer one has to wait for 2 years with first sponspor even if he gives NOC, some said one year is fine provided NOC is there etc. Thanks again
Q2119_C4	ANy updates? did hi fairdeal?  ANy updates? did you manage to change sponsor?? we have same situation now..
Q2119_C5	Its great that you have NOC. Its great that you have NOC. You can transfer your sponsorship after one year.
Q2119_C6	normally it's 2 years. Could normally it's 2 years. Could be 1, in certain circumstances and on the exceptional bases.
Q2119_C7	The rule is you have to have The rule is you have to have been with your first sponsor for 2 yrs before you can transfer to another and that too only if you get an NOC.  If the employer for some reason does give u an NOC before the 2 yr period is over you still cannot trf your sponsor to a new guy cuz the immigration will not accept. so for such cases you will be working as a 'borrowed' employee till you complete the 2 yrs.  we just faced this situ in our office
Q2119_C8	Tinker...I changed my Tinker...I changed my sponsorship from my first sponsor right after one year. There were no special circumstances involved, so I suppose, its one year. Two years ban is mostly for those whose visa has been cancelled.

Q2126_C3	RE: Switzerland Visa HI. I'm also applying for Schengen Visa right now and we have the same issue. During the past 3 years I always have to send my documents to Swiss Embassy in Kuwait but since Oct 1, 2012, they implemented VIS which requires personal appearance so they can take your biometric data which will be valid for 5 years. I called the embassy if there is no other alternative than going to Kuwait and i was told none. so i decided to change my itinerary and go to Germany first so I can apply in German embassy instead.  Tips. You have to show them that your point of entry is Germany and/or you will spend most of your stay in Germany. ( tickets and hotel bookings as proof).   Goodluck!

If you've been to KL before, then you'd know. Careful of the "working ladies" around some of the pubs - enforcement not as strict as Qatar :-0   Renaissance Melaka - nice.  Evergreen Laurel in Penang - not sure but think should be fine. Penang Island is very nice.  Japamala Resort in Tioman - this one, my pals said is really very nice. Langkawi is also very nice, maybe better as on the west coast and away from the monsoon side. Duty free alcohol too.   /Are you sure you don't want to change venue? The accommodation may be cheap for an expensive resort like that but if it's raining all the time and seas are rough, don't think you can go diving or snorkeling even. Best timing for East Coast of Malaysia is March to October or early Nov. before monsoon season starts.    ***************************************** Don't want no drama, No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama

I am not sure if you can fly from Penang direct to Tioman ... but worth to check with Berjaya Air.   Penang should be fine for 1 week ... make sure you visit Kek Lok Si Temple and take alot of photos.   I dont know what is your liking ... but me think a week in Tioman might be a bit too long? Except if you like diving they have a beautiful diving spots in Tioman.   You need to go to Subang Airport ... to go to Tioman and book a flight with Berjaya Air.

Q2141	Plugs from UK? Hello - am just wondering about moving stuff over from the UK - will our electricals work out there - dvd, tv. fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plugs or something? Thanks
Q2141_C1	lol Just bring your stuff, it will work either within the 'European' sockets or you get adadpters.
Q2141_C2	British 3 pin plugs will work in Qatar no problem as the sockets are the same (they were the last time I was there in 2004) TV am not sure as we bought ours in Qatar.  We bought a DVD player in Qatar and it worked fine in the UK with UK bought DVDs but again they are cheap enough to buy in Qatar.
Q2141_C3	Plug sockets here are all Plug sockets here are all 3-pin UK style. However, you might want to bring a stock of 3-pin to 2-pin adaptors with you because anything you by out here will be 2-pin, and the adapters you buy here are very low quality and I've seen many catch fire or melt.
Q2141_C4	adaptors so if all the plus sockets are 3 pin why are the products 2 pin? So do you mean I need a 2 pin to 3 pin adaptor? I am confused...sorry!
Q2141_C5	I expect plug sockets are I expect plug sockets are 3-pin cos Qatar used to be protected by the British. Just a guess.  Appliances are 2-pin cos they come from Asia I think.  It's juts one of many wonderful things that defies logic here in Qatar.  You'll need adapters that plug into the 3-pin wall socket and take a 2-pin plug.
Q2141_C6	Adapters are rubbish Have some patience and change the plugs on new items to 3-pin plugs.  I hate the adapters here, as previously mentioned the quality is rubbish and they can melt.
Q2141_C7	The same applies to the The same applies to the 3-pin plugs you buy here as the adapters - they are cheap and prone to catching fire. Best to bring your own from the UK.
Q2142	Remote car starter device installation Hi,  Is there a place close to Salwa road that they can install a remote starter device to my car ?  I have the device already i just need someone to install it.  Thank you,
Q2142_C1	RE: Remote car starter device installation While you may find someone to install it, I believe the reason you can't find them here is that being "radio controlled" they have to be allowed by the government (in order that the frequency used doesn't interfere with any of the official radio frequencies) - at least that's what I was told 8 years ago.
Q2142_C2	RE: Remote car starter device installation sorry i wanted to say government not police
Q2142_C3	RE: Remote car starter device installation These devices utilise the unlicensed frequency range which doesn't interfere with any gov official radio freq range, just like your cordless phone.     Any skilled Auto electrician should be able to install it, but be careful unskilled technician can damage your car.    These remote starters are available for sale at any cars' access shop(around 500 QR), I have one for sale if you are interested (brand new,still in box).
Q2142_C4	RE: Remote car starter device installation As a single "user" perhaps you don't have to worry.  I inquired with a North American manufacturer in order to import and sell them here - they advised that one of the documents required was a government permit for the radio frequency concerned.  As I said, it was 8 years ago.  Times change.

Q2146_C1	RE: Export my car For sure you can ship your car for the purpose. Its called as an ESCORT.  It is the same procedure that you take the vehicle to other GCC places.  You have to apply for a permission to export the vehicle as an ESCORT. But make sure that the vehicle is registered under your name and not in the bank. Otherwise you have to obtain an NOC from the bank.  Also there is an additional charge for Insurance.  Then you have to consult a shipment company and you have to make a two way bill.  Once it reach there in India no need to pay any Taxes.  As per my knowledge you can use the vehicle there in India up to 1 year

Q2149_C3	RE: Car Comparison : Prado to Mazda CX9 CX9 is more crossoverish whereas Prado is a proper SUV and looks like one too.  A Toyota is definitely more reliable than Mazda.
Q2149_C4	RE: Car Comparison : Prado to Mazda CX9 The ONLY advantage of Prado is the resale value.  Both are not real Off-road options. So for on-road CX-9 is much more fun to drive (acceleration & Stability) and much better looking. The myth of the Toyota being more reliable is a very local belief that has no facts to support it. Also don't fall for the claim of low cost maintenance of Toyota. I have a LC; the brakes Master and booster costs 8000 QAR which is double the CADILAC ESCALADE that is claimed to be one of the highest when it comes to maintenance cost.

Q2157_C6	Nara Salon Nara Salon is on Al Waab Street (same street as Villagio). It's about 300m from the Teyseer petrol station as you head toward the new junction.  My wife owns it. I think it's about QR60 for a regular manicure and QR80 for a regular pedicure (she's not here right now so I can't ask her), and they also do haircuts, hair treatments, make up, facial treatments, waxing and threading, and henna art.  You can call 44478008 for an appointment - there's also a mobile number for the manager (Joanne)33843371 and if you want to see some pictures there's a Facebook page (just search for Nara Salon).  Right now they are also having a sale on Makeup Forever products.  If you tell them you heard of the salon through me (Steve) you should get a discount on treatments as well.  If you do go, please let me know what you think as my wife is always looking for feedback on improving the salon and services.
Q2157_C7	Steve, if I'm leaving Steve, if I'm leaving Villagio, is it before or after Al Bustan St.?
Q2157_C8	Minoush ..... No idea, lol.  It's at the opposite end of Al Waab, and on the opposite side.  When you see the Teyseer Petrol Station on your right, take the cut into the service road that runs parallel to Al Waab.  You will see a row of shops (the usual supermarket, men's barber, electrical shop, grocer and supermarket) and the salon is right next to them.   Good luck !!

Q2159	Vegetable market and wholesale market Hi,  I went to the wholesale market on Saturday but couldn't buy anything as I had to buy boxes only of vegetables that I would have had to waste...  I was told that there is also a vegetable market where I can buy by the kg...can anybody explain me where it is?  Thanks...
Q2159_C1	RE: Vegetable market and wholesale market Vegetable market You probably went to the one where you park your car in front of a row of shops selling produce?   They sell in volume (boxes only)  RIGHT ACROSS from it is the other more visited market.  You have to go inside one of the open doors to see the true market.  There you can buy just 1 tomato, 1 carrot etc. They are next to each other.
Q2159_C2	RE: Vegetable market and wholesale market I completely disagree with that.  In my experience (over 5 years here now)  the Fruit & Vegetable market produce is BY AND FAR the best you can buy in Doha.   The grocery stores have improved, but they cannot match the freshness from of the wholesale market.

Q2163	is direct employment safe? hi everyone,  i'd like to get your opinion and/or comments...  is it safe to consider direct employment?  would appreciate your feedback...=)
Q2163_C1	nice thanks whyteknight...that's good to hear..are you from phils?
Q2163_C2	lp, it's true lp, it's true
Q2163_C3	Direct Employement.... Based on my experience, yes its quite safe than in agency..more cost beneficial between the employer and employee.....
Q2163_C4	Hi meryl317..re your queries.. If your cousin have the visa already from her present employer...my advice is to present a Standard Employment contract which i have a format here if you want i will send you the format on which you will attest or her employer in POLO. You can follow there the req. for direct hire.
Q2163_C5	ilazzie, ask lng sana. na ilazzie, ask lng sana. na email ko na sa frend ko ang work visa from the company..   I advised her to go to the nearest DHL office para sa authentication ng visa nya.. is it the right step? and can you please tell me what she needs to do next? is medical check-up required?  please do advice me, excited na yung frend ko na mkawork dito pero nalilito kami paano i-process ang papers nya sa pinas..
Q2163_C6	meryl, English only in the meryl, English only in the main forum.. what kind of visa does your friend have? if it's only visit visa, no need for medical check up, just authentication from the Embassy.
Q2163_C7	if she's holding a work visa if she's holding a work visa she needs to undergo medical examination in the Philippines. it's better to be sure she have all necessary documents, you never know what documents the officers in our airport require.. sometimes, they can be very strict..
Q2163_C8	if she is holding a working if she is holding a working visa, she really needs to undergo medical exam, visa stamping in Qatar Embassy in Phils, also in POEA she will be required to submit original copy of her contract.
Q2163_C9	Lp, fortunately the contract Lp, fortunately the contract i submitted in POEA was accepted even when it did not have authentication yet from qatar embassy
Q2163_C10	to treysdad as per the procedures given to me, i will go to POEA only when visa has already been stamped by Qatar Embassy here in Phils...  here is what's written... 5.Once the passport with stamped visa was received, proceed to Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) for verification of the of employment contract and submit the following document for issuance of exit pass or Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC): Original employment contract Visa Medical Certificate PRC License Pre-departure orientation seminar certificate (to be scheduled and provided by POEA)  got very nice support from the employer, it was them who introduced QL to me. =)
Q2163_C11	will it be safe if i go to will it be safe if i go to poea only after visa stamping or should i go there even before that?
Q2163_C12	You better start with your Medical Certificate because it usually takes 3 days to a week for the results. They will only release the results once you have the visa. But it's better to start it so that if you have problems (like high sugar, high blood pressure, etc.) you can take corrective actions or take a second opinion and try to get better medical results and have "fit to work" evaluation.
Q2163_C13	i was supposed to have the i was supposed to have the medical earlier than receviing the visa but unfortunately the clinic i went required me to present my visa first. hopefully my health did not go bad after undertaking annual physical exam for my current employer.  another thing, do you know of any qatar embassy accredited clinics are worth visiting? i have read in some posts that there are really those clinics who tend to harvest money from aspiring ofws. i wish to go to a clinic that can me fair result whether or not positive but at least it is true. wish ko lang...heheh.. sa mga taga jan baka meron sila mairecommend na clinics dito sa pinas...
Q2163_C14	maybe, just make sure you maybe, just make sure you check the company that you will be working for...like i told you, my cousin used to work there but resigned, but she was not directly employed from the Phils...
Q2163_C15	thank you so much mj. will thank you so much mj. will you be kind to let me contact your cousin? i wish to at least ask some few questions...she/he can contact me at jolisa.b.calib@gmail.com.. would really appreciate it...
Q2163_C16	First thing you do when you set your foot here, LOG ON TO QL! Lol!  Good luck, make sure you have the OEC and that you will be a documented OFW!
Q2163_C17	so by direct hire you meant, so by direct hire you meant, they will be sending you a working visa from here? correct me if i'm wrong..
Q2163_C18	to flor1212 thanks, will do that...=)
Q2163_C19	If you are asking about If you are asking about direct employment versus contract employment, I would prefer direct.
Q2163_C20	Laws in our country discourage it, but many try their luck.  Many safenets were placed to make sure that an OFW will be safe once in foreign country.  If you are a direct hire but goes with the official protocols (except you did not pass through an agency), it's okay because you will be a documented OFW.  But if you are a direct hire and not an official OFW, I also discouraged it!
Q2163_C21	it's direct employment it's direct employment against employment via recruitment agency
Q2163_C22	recruitment agencies are only recruitment agencies are only after their commissions so is generally better to go direct, unless the company is disreputable........in which case there are many here.
Q2163_C23	Jlazzzie.. I am a direct hire. What you need to do is check first the company hiring you. For me it was easy because I knew some compatriots who worked for the company in its different branches here in the Gulf Region.  Also please check the process in POEA, I believe they have changed it last year. So the process I went through is not the same anymore where I had to go through each step myself. As far as I know it is not anymore "direct hire" or "named hire" per se as you will need to have your documents processed through an employment agency and not by yourself.
Q2163_C24	i too was hired direct... and its safe..but as Mr. Treysdad sez,,,check first the company and then later there are still some papers to process from POEA... Congratz and Goodluck! :)
Q2163_C25	i will do as you say...but i will do as you say...but the soon-to-be employer even sent me a lengthy step by step procedure to accomplish up to POEA...  treysdad hopefully, i wont need agency anymore. my papers are already with the employer for visa processing.hope it would be released this week.  jaryz, thanks for your comment...

Q2164_C3	RE: how to Lose weight??? Hi,  Honestly, there is no quick way. An unhealthy way is to take a diaretic, but you will lose only water, not fat. That is a temp. fix.   As far as medication, there is only one which is called Orlistat. It inhibits the enzyme that breaks down fat, so this will allow fats to pass through you. Other than that, the other diet aids are false, or caffiene-based. In that case, drink coffee.  The not eating rice at night is good advice. Remember, it is down to physics: when you eat about 7500 more calories than you burned, you gained a kg. the same is true for losing it.

Q2180_C2	RE: Labour Laws - The Labour Law states that employers must provide housing or housing allowance. - The employment contract sets the terms and conditions for employment which should include amount of housing or provision of accomodation - The employer should not claim back any money paid for housing as long as this has not been previously agreed. - She can complain at the Labour Department on C ring road, but this will of course put her in trouble and the company may then terminate her contract and send her back home. - The advise is she needs to reach an agreement with her employer. - One question is if the other company provided her with accomdation, was that for free? was it agreed with her employer? - It is very tricky but what does her contract say? hope this helps

Q2189_C1	This kind of practices could This kind of practices could have been paced out sooner for white collar jobs however for technical jobs it could be the different in approach and superiority to do trouble shooting and problem solving. However for companys doing a simple processes and routines, theres no reason for differences in pay.
Q2189_C2	Supply and demand, Supply and demand, capitalism 101 pure and simple. If enough well educated, well trained, well experienced, well qualified 'Asians' (Japanese usually get higher offer) refused to work for a quarter of salary of a comparable Europeans then in theory the companies will have to offer more to attract them.  Unfortunately, in practice for every Asian that refuse to work for a quarter of the European's salary there are ten more lining up to work for one-fifth.  I think the question should be re-phrased: Why would company hire a European/American/Australian/Japanese etc for four times the salary of a comparably qualified 'Asians'?????  Cheers SK

The sad reality is that most company are impressed with the way they look and converse in English...but of course!! that's their mother tongue. But let them write a proper business letter...most of them are unprofessional. Some company look also for the passport when hiring people. But you know what? If your company got nonsense recruitment personnel and system...they easily deceived by westerns. No offense to Western people but these point of view are based on facts...however some of them are qualified as well...not being unfair and speaking generally.
Q2189_C5	It's to do with the cost of It's to do with the cost of living in home countries and other aspects.  If you look around, on the whole, a Western Expat will get more in Asia, Russia and africa also.
Q2189_C6	Nobody is Perfect - I am Nobody is Perfect - I am Nobody  I think arabs are in awe of Europeans and afraid of them. I think maybe they feel inferior to them or do not want to look cheap in front of them so they give them more salary to show that they are also superior and can afford them.....even though the European guy maybe out of work and usless in his country and desperate to get some work here.He just wants to come here for a couple of  years to have some fun & sun and escape the cold and rain for while and spice up his resume to resettle back with some real work experience.   At least thats what i have seen in Doha for the last 10 years. I have no grouse against them nor have i been affected adversly by them at any point of  time. ........Just my opinion.
Q2189_C7	I'm asking a Hi Alexa, I'm asking a rethorical question about why would companies hire a 'Westerner' (I prefer to use this term) for 4 times the salary of 'Asians'.  According to a pure cost-benefit point of view, they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the Westerner.   Question is, do they(companies or state for this matter) get what they bargained for?    The answer is (if indeed it is true that westerner are paid 4 times more, a proposition that need to be investigated further) a resounding YES, as we can see more westerner is arriving and based on the cost benefit principle above, companies feel that they still get ahead by hiring  westerners. Here we assume that no one (companies or states) is stupid enough to prefer losing instead of winning.  There's a catch though. By 'productivity' they may not only refer to  tangible things such as amount of product you produce or sales achievement. It may also  include things such as prestige (ie. this real estate company is under British management) or something as cynical (as another poster put it) fear or subconcious inferiority complex. True or nor, I don't know....  Myself, If I think I am underpaid (dont really care what my colleages get), then I'll try to negotiate a better deal. If I cannot get a better deal, then I try to prove that I am underpaid by looking at a better job that give me more. If I cannot find a better job, then may be I'm paid exactly what my market worth is....... might as well shut my mouth and enjoy......  (NOte: 'paid' here mean the total compensation I get: sallary, job satisfaction,quality of live, traffic, red tapes etc).  Enough bubling past my curfew. Adios for tonight, cheers SK
Q2189_C8	Your passport carries more Your passport carries more weight than your work around here..

Q2189_C15	I don't see any problem with the practice ...of 'Pay for Nationality'. The labour laws of Qatar are primitive and pre industrialization practices have continued to date. Companies need to realize that the world has moved forward. The logic behind this practice is not ignorance as many would think,it is more of a feeling of applying economics around cost of living in the country of origin and extrapolating it to arrive at the salary figures. This has been taken directly from SaudiAramco.    Source:  - A study Conducted by FriedUnicorn - Vol I (September,1999)
Q2189_C16	I want to tell all my Indian I want to tell all my Indian friends that if these idiots want to spend their money by paying four times whatever a white skinned drunkard racist braggart is  worth, why should we mind it?

Q2189_C23	because its called quality of work.. we have pride in what we do That is why we are getting 3 or more times the salary, we are not late to work, not sick day all the time. Pride in our work. and as stated Quality of work..  I have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western.  When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say, I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track. The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path. Safety was one of the main issues, Accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked.  I am happy they employ Asians here, it makes us guys look good. So thank you for your poor quality of workmanship and organization skill, you qualification may be high on paper..

Q2189_C25	westerners are schooled,,, to be individualistic,,,which is not the case at all in the east,,,this allows westerners to make an informed decision on the spot... and westerners come in all colours, I was not narrowing the field to whites,,,, like it, lump it, do what you want with it, but its the truth,,, I am just being objective....
Q2189_C26	What is a Westerner ? What is a Westerner ? Someone who is from Europe, US, Canada Etc. ? or someone who comes from a developed country ? There are many of us going around whom are paid salaries that is the same as local hire or asian hire also in many countries !  Do not think it is fair to generalise that Westerners get paid more for everything. It depends on the job and scope that you are involved in.  Also bear in mind, even though Qatar is personal income tax free, some expats still have to pay taxes or other in their home countries which also accounts for higher pays.
Q2189_C27	I suppose a person on western wages... ... can't afford to spend a lot of time during the day on QL - too much work and responsibilities... and that's just ONE reason.  For once I have to agree with Jackfrost:  Quote: 'I have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western. When they had Local or Asian in the job it all went to Crap so to say, I was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track. The procedures were in place but the Asians or Local where too lazy to follow the path. Safety was one of the main issues, Accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked.'  He needs some work on his english skills but I have to agree with him. My husband has been working overseas for over 30 years now and the responsibility will only be given to somebody who can take the shit the position makes you go through and actually deal with it. You need to be firm, have capacity to argue the necessary points and leadership personality. And unfortunately there are a lot of people who lack these requirements.

I am willing to put my education and knowledge to the test against any of the western expatriates working here in similar field and there won't be much difference.  As for someone mentioning above that Indians come here because they can't get job anywhere else, well I work for the same company here for which I was working in India, the company which picked me from my campus so maybe the desire of not leaving that company got me here rather than any lack of job opportunity.     <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Q2189_C31	Colour discrimination occurs Colour discrimination occurs everywhere, if you don't know that then you have lived in a very protective world.

Q2189_C37	I have a basic question. For I have a basic question. For how many Indians, middle east is first choice for work? Usually, those who work here are already rejected from US and european countries ( and 70% are rejected by their own country) I don't know about other fields, but the doctors working in middle east are substandard compared to their own counterparts in India and the european doctors are even more substandard to these already substandard doctors.    Now, the conclusion is that quality control is a joke here. Employing few europeans (and one or two Americans) makes things look good. But they can't afford more than few and so they employ majority asians at cheapest rates to be cost effective, And the end result is a substandard organisation which spends lots of money, has poor performance and manipulated quality control( usually through media).   Are you nuts?......no doubt I am crazy about you!
Q2189_C38	Quite clearly,you haven't Quite clearly,you haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about & you haven't interacted with a lot of educated,informed,well travelled NON-WESTERNERS...probably has something to do with the fact that you're a racist bigot...THERE'S an informed decision...from a NON-WESTERNER...deal with it...
Q2189_C39	/-a-t-/ sun26872...middle @ sun26872...middle east is first choice for MANY Indians so you're completely wrong about that one,for a lot of Indians,they don't mind coming to the mideast 'cos it's just a 3hr. flight from home,earnings are tax-free & there are a lot of people from their community/town/village...they can't find that in the west,it's too cold from them for half the year or more,it's halfway around the world & no way would they be able to afford that 16 hr. flight ticket once a year like they do here & they pay tax on their earnings,put yourself in their shoes,would the west still be your first choice?...i thought not...You are right about the fact that most of the good Indian doctors(& India produces some of the best on the planet as i presume you know already) choose to stay @ home or go west but it would be unfair to say that because of that ALL Indian doctors in the mideast are substandard or the European doctors here for that matter...a lot of them move,again for the tax-free income,to try a new place,a new lifestyle,a life partner who's based here,there are so many things that factor into that descision... Quality control as you rightly stated is in most cases a joke but again that doesn't apply across the board...a well trained person,wherever it is they are from,is unlikely to compromise on standards...

Q2189_C44	if you knew my salary if you knew my salary ,Jackfrost, you will get a frostbite.     I am agree with everyone that if you have signed a contract, you shouldn't complaint. Likewise, I maintain that Europeans and Americans working here are of inferior quality than their Asian counterpart, but I don't have a problem with that too because their salary doesn't come from my account.   Europeans are very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies.But I personally consider a great quality to be a convincing liar because nothing succeeds like money. I wish we Asians learn to stop working hard and start convincing people of our leadership qualities and individualism. But then who will do the real work?

Q2189_C53	To make it easy for some people to understand I will give you an example that might show you a reason why lets say Filipinos as mentioned in this thread are earning little bit less than other nationalities:  Check this address, or else read below my comment to one filipina lady who envy others who get more than her husband: http://www.qatarliving.com/node/825227  X is a civil Engineer from Manila working in W Consturction Company and earning 5000 USD per month.  Y is a civil Engineer from US working in W Construction Company and earning 7500 USD per month.  Both X and Y has 13 years experiance in thier field.  Why X earns 5000 USD and Y earns 7500 USD per month?  Discrimination?  My opinion is:  - X needs to work in W Construction Company for 5 years to save money for buying a house back home in the Philippines.  - Y needs to work in W Construction Company for 15 years to save money for buying a house back home in the US.  - X has one son only who goes to Z university( One of the best well known expensive universities in the Philippines)where the fees are 30 000 peso (2300 QR!!) per year.  - Y has one son also who goes to G University(which is one of the humble small universities in California) where the fees are 20 000 USD (73 000 QR).  - X has a wife working in Kuwait with one son only and a mistress in Manila and a gf in Qatar. He has to support himself only and maybe send some gifts for his son from time to time.   - Y has a wife who is taking care of 6 children back home and he is the only one responsible for the whole family.  - If X is single and would like to get married, it won't cost him more than lets say 100 000 Peso (7600 QR) for one of the best wedding in a luxarious Cruise in the Ocean.  - If Y is single and originate, but a Muslim, he can not get married with less than 100 000 USD (365 000 QR) due to how expensive are weddings in the US, Hotels, Wedding Planner Companies, The Mahr (might reach millions) which is supposed to be given to the wife as a gift to buy all what she needs and would love to have.  Many Empployers know these facts and many others when recruiting staff.  If any of us is not satisfied with his job, then he better go straight home, or is it only Jelousy and Envy? For what? Although his income is more than yours, most probably you got better life than him back home. Better House, Your kids are enrolling in better schools and universities...etc  So please enough Envy.
Q2189_C54	maybe the answer is how much you have negotiated your salary? I have one main principle regarding this story: you are asking for an amount. If you are receiving what you have asked for, why are you complaining. If the offer is lower, why have you accepted it? On the other hand I know a lot of Indians or Iranians that are paid better than me. So, maybe is not the nationality. Each of us consider himself the most beautiful/handsome, the smartest, the most skilled etc. person. Maybe is not true, have you think about this??

Q2189_C63	Agree with my exiled friend Agree with my exiled friend (hope I can call you a friend). It is not racism per se but rather a nationalism, pasportism or perhaps  Jawaazsafarism (please correctt my Arabic).  In many companies  Mr Tendulkar  will get the same package as Mr Collingwood eventhough he just get his british passport last week. However without an Australian passport Mr Afridi will not get the same as Mr Ponting despite the fact that he had lived, study and work all  his live there.  Oh well, in the end no one force us to sign that dotted line and no one (I assume) hold our passports and prevent us to say goodbye.  Cheers SK
Q2189_C64	On a general level, On a general level, westerners seem to be able to DEMONSTRATE better levels of leadership and trouble shooting. (Just see how many countries are there in the west that are poor/under developed/developing compared to Asia/Africa. and its not that they have an advantage of natural resources or climate over others)They can also sell themselves well. They also tend to grasp the bigger picture well, compared to the Asians who excel in specialising in a particular discipline of study. But then, this is only a generalisation.  This is not to say there arent any asians who cant do the same. Whether you look at Mittal/TATA/SONY etc and what they have achieved in the west, the Asians who work at high profile jobs in western countries or the IIM/IIT graduates who are almost completely recruited by western companies, there are enough proofs for Asian talent and capabilities.   But the issue is that, due to the problems intrinsic to the demographics of Asian population, there is quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not been fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterparts could attain. This particular section, which is quite sizeable, tips the balance when it comes to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce.  Also, I am not quite sure how it works out in the west. Do they pay less for asian employees, like here in the middle east?  if not, that is another pointer, which could tell us that the workforce from Asia that ends up in gulf(that includes yours truly)is somehow the ones that couldnt make it in their own homes or in the west. It could also mean the ME perception of Asians has a hand in this.  Before accusing anybody of RACISM in this matter, what the Asians should think about is, what exactly weighs in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them. Its not skin, its more than passport, its the BRAND that has been created around it.  Like how sony made it in the west.Morita knew how to combine creative, cost-effective engineering (their core philosophy) with product marketing and brand creation.End of the day, its about brand creation.   As much as I have seen brilliant managers from west, I have also seen ones who have reached that position simply by virtue of their passport. That is what you call brand value.(Not saying that there arent local/Asian managers who have been lucky in a similiar way, for them its other reasons) Have we reached a place where we are ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for us?

Q2189_C66	Estong,If westerns were Estong, If certain westerns were offered what certain Asian countries pay their citizens, I don't think that you would have a single one of those westerners working here. This country is not a country where we settle here with our families for good, its just a base camp, to make some money to fuel our lives back home, and that we all know have different costs. Not saying that this is correct but its one of the factors that ME does what they do and gets away with it!

I don't think any canadian would agree to come to qatar and work here for 5000 QR. Home he/she will get this QR5000 (about CAN$ 1,500)as unemployment benefit.   Blame rather YOUR government which makes you guys working for US$100-200 a month, and to be happy that you got a chance at least to get this job.   <i> <b> ********************* "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."  </b> Oliver Wendell Holmes</i>   <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">

Q2189_C74	mohammed - Typical Asian Mentality, your employer is not your provider. Stop being envious, Hasad will deprive you fragrance of Jannah  Abu Tharr may Allaah be pleased with him said: "I heard the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam said: `When forty-two nights are passed, Allaah sends an angel to the nutfah (embryo) and he gives it shape, forming its hearing and sight, its skin, flesh and bones. Then he says: `O Lord, male or female?' Then your Lord decrees whatever He wills and the angel writes it down.'" [Muslim]   Another hadith  "Each one of you comes together in mother's womb for forty days, then becomes an 'Aalaqah (clot) for a similar period of time. Then he becomes a Mudhghah (chewed lump of flesh) for a similar length of time. Then Allaah sends an angel to him, who is commanded with four things. It is said to him: Write down his deeds, his provision, and whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise). Then the soul is breathed into him.'"   Al-Bukhaari

Q2189_C77	People may RACISM!!!!!!!!  People may try to be politically correct here but that's what it is.. Anyone of you who doesn't think this is because of your passport is welcome to send me a message and I will show them the power of the colour of the passport, atleast at 50 places in a single day in Qatar.. Get real people.... STOP PRETENDING THAT RACISM HAS GONE AWAY!!!!!!
Q2189_C78	The color of the passport The color of the passport may be the first selection criteria (we all agree that this is wrong and subjective) but I hope that most of the cases the evaluation of skills, competences, education and experience will be the determining factors!  I am obviously referring to Lead Positions!
Q2189_C79	Laurana,I was teasing you Laurana,  I was teasing you in response to the way you referred to 2 countries ;)
Q2189_C80	Its not racism, it may be Its not racism, it may be nationalitism to create a new word but they are people with western passports who are non-white that earn 'western' money.  It may be wrong but you signed the contract when you came so it was your decision. Maybe go home and negotiate better for your next contract and if they don't give you what you want, then don't come.
Q2189_C81	/-a-t-/ Dohadiesel,eh? @ Dohadiesel,eh? aren't you on the wrong thread about this?!...there's a LOT more choice in Singapore than there is here,as for the prices,since you're living there & i haven't been there for a good few months now,your beer will be cheaper in Qatar than it is in Singapore & i stand corrected...there you go,yipee!! cheaper beer,"rasvegas" awaits your imminent arrival!!!...this little boy has something you might want to ponder,just like you live in Singapore & know more about the price of a pint than i do,i live here,you don't & if you think the cheaper pints are going to make up for ALL the shit one has to deal with here,think again my friend...we ALL must give up something to gain something,such is life,there's no dodging it...so yes,you'll get tax-free pay & the pints are cheaper but unless you plan to turn into a raging alcoholic on the grog 24/7,i don't see how that will significantly affect your life here...HOWEVER,there will be a LOT you'll be giving up that you took for granted in Singapore...essential difference here my friend,i've lived in BOTH places in question,well lived in one,currently live in the other,you on the other hand,have ONLY lived in one,so it'd be prudent to reserve judgement before actually coming & living here don't you think?...sometimes one can learn a lot from observing kids *wink*!!...have a good one!...
Q2189_C82	Nic, no problem I can take it even if it was for real. My point was just: "if you don't like it who's keeping you here? There are two full lists for every of us regarding pro- or anti- working as an expat. We are the sole responsible for our acts and decisions. I could work in Germany for almost the same money as here. Part of my decision was to gain some ME experience and to live in a more quite environment. I am not sure 100% it was the wisest thing but I am not complaining about it.. Anyhow, nice to meet you. Hope you are enjoying the life here... :)
Q2189_C83	Laurana,Honestly, the only Laurana, Honestly, after all the professional frustrations I've been through here, the only reason that retains me in this country is the money! I can ensure you that ME experience is NOT an asset and it is often seen as a disadvantage when you'll try to reintegrate the western job market. It is well known in the west that the professional standards in the ME are very low. There are several reasons, just to name a few: blind localization and promotions of unqualified, non-competent and uneducated local people in lead positions; low work-force salaries, non-existent real HR policies, etc... Nobody is motivated here to pursue a career as all know that won't happen...and so many more... in summary this is not a normal country where hard work, innovation, leadership and results are rewarded accordingly. This is a country where the wealth pours out of the soil, regardless people being hard working or being passive and do the minimum to get the most... the second scenario is the actual reality and the locals are to lazy or to incompetent or the hopeless to control this disgrace.
Q2189_C84	Nic, I am glad I haven't seen your comment before coming here..... I agree with you. But now I will finish what I have started. After that, we'll see.....

Q2189_C86	Sandeep.. I would disagree and suggest that It's probably a Lebanese outfit..
Q2189_C87	It depends on the company, It depends on the company, and the contract. In my company, the position dictates the salary and there is some "wiggle room" in negotiating a higher salary or benefits if you bring something spectacular to the table (like great negotiating skills, I guess).  I don't know how it is elsewhere, but I guess my question is: if you are so unhappy with your contract, why did you sign it?
Q2189_C88	Laurana People who complain why others get more than them are usually social climbers who can't eat back home, and once they come here they forget about thier origin and start comparing themself with others. Why and Why?  To make it short, If you don't like it, get the hell out of here and go somewhere else. Thats it.

Q2207_C5	RE: Where is a good place to buy an Acoustic guitar? Badie Studio near the Souqs is definitely the best place.  You will get personal attention and very good advice.  I bought a guitar there last September.  Ray was very helpful.  THey also have a website.  Tel 4423554
Q2207_C6	RE: Where is a good place to buy an Acoustic guitar? Badie studio is probably the best bet for stylish electric guitars, though they have a good deal of acoustics too. Yamaha on the other hand, probably best known for amateurs, doesn't have a appeal to both sound and style. If you are really a music guru, then you should buy a fender. details: Music Corner Fax: +974 4374586, mail: musiccorner@qatar.net.qa

Q2210	physician contract negotiations Does anybody have any pearls regarding physician contract negotiations?  Thanks for your thoughts.
Q2210_C1	Thanks for your reply! That Thanks for your reply! That is interesting. I am coming from N America...so you really think I can ask for 25% more, when in Qatar I'll be earning tax free dollars?
Q2210_C2	Watch out for those "tax free Watch out for those "tax free dollars." You still owe taxes in the US and if you are Canadian you have to divest of all property and financial ties in order to qualify for tax free status. And yes, 25% is considered fair,if not minimal. Mandi
Q2210_C3	Yes, I am divesting, so all $ Yes, I am divesting, so all $ will be tax free. However, I was recently offered a job in Saudi for half the gross I am currently earning (consultant), and they didn't budge in negotiations. I am hoping that Qatar has deeper pockets, or it won't be worth it. So...I'm thinking that going in with a starting position of current gross plus 25 might be a little extreme, given the regional remuneration.
Q2210_C4	Oh yes, I am very Western and Oh yes, I am very Western and very white. May I ask how you come by your advice?
Q2210_C5	25% plus plus has been the 25% plus plus has been the standard package for westerners for Hamad Medical Corp and for the six American universities in Qatar.

Q2210_C7	No, the private clinics won't No, the private clinics won't pay anything and you can see why when you look at their fees. Compared to the West, medical care is vey cheap here. The only places that MAY pay Western rates for Western physicians are HMC (if they recruit you) and Aspetar. Mandi

All they like to do is blame other nationalities for being bad drivers while its them who contributes to it.   I have motorcycles here btw, but only ride at night well after 11 usually.   Cause yeah, car drivers are depressingly bad here. They are usually surprised when they see a motorcycle and dont know how to react to one near them. They will turn without looking, get into the fast lane and drive 20 below the limit, stomp on the brakes and come to a virtual stop at the speed cameras.   I can go on and on but I dont wanna stay here all night to describe just how horrible car drivers in qatar are.

Q2223	Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? Any good and bad experiences with Jeep Wrangler?
Q2223_C1	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? Wow... where do I start... haha Give us some more information, what year? Model? From the dealer or 2nd hand?  Then, I can tell you more!
Q2223_C2	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? Not a good buy. I would never recommend it even as a second car for off road activity.
Q2223_C3	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? All Ammrican cars have bad resale value in Qatar. You should expect to loose around 30% to 35% on the cost of the car in the first year.
Q2223_C4	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? I had a Jeep not so long ago and I pleased to say 'Goodbye'
Q2223_C5	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? Hasan is right on the resale value. The 4-door wrangler should do you fine as a daily driver and work out for camping trips. I guess you gotta love the car if you're going to buy an older one. Either way, good luck finding a car that suits you!
Q2223_C6	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? Id watch out if i were you in regards to the resale value for sure in addition, i prefer the older engines, 2004 and down if im not mistaken. the 4.0? the new 3.7 feels so tied up while flooring it.  dam all the eco constraints theyre enforcing on the big boy cars nowadays  conclusion: if you want it for an everyday car, then dont want it that much, you could do better if you are into poping the bonnet every now and then and enjoy it, go for it (preferably older) as mentioned in previous threads
Q2223_C7	RE: Would you recommend Jeep Wrangler as a good buy? I follow carefully reports and reviews on cars regarding durability, maintenance and reliability.  To be honest, Dodge and Chrysler (including Jeep) are among the least reliable cars around. A recent study by Forbes in the USA shows that these manufacturers along with GMC top their list of least reliable cars.  A list which no Japanese or Korean manufacturer made! Interestingly, cars manufactured by FORD for the past five years are among the most reliable.  Jeeps have been well known for their mountain and dune climbing capabilities, but when it comes to road driving, you'd better slow down before buying one and see all other alternatives.  A Ford Explorer may be a good choice if you are looking for an American car at the same price tag (or even cheaper) than the Jeep.  But for Qatar, if you can, get your self one of these:  1- Toyota Prado. 2- Nissan Pathfinder or X-Terra 3- Mitsubishi Pajero 4- Honda Pilot  They are the least to lose at reselling by order. They are also very reliable and have a large range of options to choose from.

Q2230	Apple iPhone question Hi, Just wondering if its cheaper/better to get a locked iphone from the US and get it unlocked in Doha? or buy new in Qatar? Does anyone know how much an iphone costs in Doha? whether locked or unlocked. We may be moving to Qatar soon.  Thanks
Q2230_C1	If I am not mistaken, they If I am not mistaken, they are around 2500 - 2700 riyals in Doha for 16gb.. This was from while ago, so prices may have changed - if u do a search on qatar living u can find ur answer! good luck
Q2230_C2	Thanks chmb. So it means I'd Thanks chmb. So it means I'd be better off bringing from the States? mainly because it would be cheaper, is that correct?

Q2230_C6	/-a-t-/crazyjoy, find me a @crazyjoy, find me a 32GB factory unlocked 3GS in Qatar and I'll buy 10.  The cheapest I've seen so far is Starlink at 3,800 and also seen them for 3,100 in HongKong.   If you bought it for 3,100 then there's delivery, risk of customs tax, and/or damage. best case it would be 3,400 to your door :)  Anyway, I recommend getting an iPhone factory unlocked rather than unlocking it because everytime you update you will have to worry.  If you want to unlock it just use iPWN.  __________________________  <a href="http://blog.iloveqatar.net"><img src="http://iloveqatar.net/images/mrqql.png" border="0">Mr. Q's Blog - A Qatari's view on Qatar.</a>

Q2232_C1	We had that done at a We had that done at a relatives house here. it wasnt the entire ceremony as there are restrictions to that and not possible to bring in a priest so it was a simple ceremony but we got registerd at the embassy legalising it.
Q2232_C2	tinkerbell That clears a lot of things.  I was specifically talking about the Qatari family court. Some expat communities in Qatar have some kind of marriage officials over here, whether it is at their embassies or outside.  In my case, since my wife and I are of different nationalities, we could not get married at the embassy.
Q2232_C3	IchWill - some laws in this IchWill - some laws in this country just amaze me. different rules for diff nationalities for the same issue. at the end of the day it all boils down to money...dont understand why they cant just take the cash and make things simpler!!!!
Q2232_C4	tinkerbell As far as the family court is concerned only one law applies to all nationalities. They genuinely did not care what our nationalities were. They only care about religion... I am not saying that is any better.
Q2232_C5	Ichwill - yeah that Ichwill - yeah that too....case to case scenario actually. in this instance yes its religion but there are many other issues pertaining to visas etc and every nationality has something diff to produce. believe me the ppl sitting at the counters themselves have differing opinions on what papaers need to be submitted for what....recent hair raising exp with my labour card....&^&&%

Q2232_C10	britexpat; britexpat; yes, someone who was employed by a company here and on a seperate RP.  Employer / Sponsor has NOTHING to do with marriage of employee.  Provided both bride and groom have valid RPs in Qatar, the family court in Qatar will only ask for a letter of approval from the father of the bride if he is not physically present in the court during the wedding, and an attested/translated civic record or something that proves the bride is not married. In addition to doing a medical test and bringing 2 witnesses to court, there is nothing else to it.  However, keep in mind that the family court here will only marry a Muslim male to a Muslim or Christian female. They will not carry out the marriage of the groom is not a Muslim or if the bride is not a Muslim nor Christian.  Only one exception to this rule: Female cabin crew working at Qatar Airways.
Q2232_C11	Yes Ichwill i did get married Yes Ichwill i did get married here according to our religious rites and then had to get a formal one done at our embassy and submitted the NOC to my embassy and attested it. when i had my child here i had to submit a similar letter stating i was sponsored by my company to HMC.....
Q2232_C12	britey - that happens when britey - that happens when both have diff sponsors....i had to give one too many yrs back.

I also heard some single lady teacher assistants in some  private schools unfortunately were let go because of the same situation and had to be replaced also with ladies with husband-sponsored visas.  But you can try your luck.

Q2249	Does a diet rich in garlic, onions and hot Indian spices give immunity against H1N1 flu? Are Asians more resistant to this new strain of influenza? Do statistics coroborate this view?
Q2249_C1	RE: Does a diet rich in garlic, onions and hot Indian... There haven't been enough cases for them to collaborate statistics on which cultures are more prone to being infected. An no, I highly doubt Asians, or those who eat those types of food have any particular immunity to it. It is very similar to the common cold, however because it is new, no one has an immunity to it because no one has ever been exposed to it before. The best you can do is eat healthily and provide your body with adequate nutrition so that your immune system is as strong as it can be to fight it off.

Q2257	Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? Recently, I spotted a post about Aramex and thought it was a neat service.  My husband, however, was less than impressed, saying we could use Fed Ex or DHL.  If you like Aramex, what are the pros over other companies?  Also, if anyone's sent/received time sensitive documents through this company, I'd like to know how your experience went. Thanks!
Q2257_C1	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? Dears,  Its a matter of support what these companies are getting in based country; as well as there own resources; however I experienced FedEx excellent in UAE, as well as DHL here in Qatar. ARAMEX, no idea Sorry.
Q2257_C2	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? Writing my experience with all of them,, I found DHL best in sending Time Sensative Documents..!! Moreover, as per my conversation with one of the Managers in DHL (who is also my friend) told me, the pressure is much less due to lack of business in recessions..so, this makes me sure that their service will be better & faster as none of your things would be queued or neglected.
Q2257_C3	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? (Dalsey, Hillblom and Lynn) DHL....(period)
Q2257_C4	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? I've sent n received too many times with all of them.Each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned.But what I noticed that DHL is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something.  And as a personal view I say all are safe enough and well servicing.The worse thing is ;you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they informed u that you have a shipment.Would be better if they could delivery at the door.  wish you the best.
Q2257_C5	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? well i dont know about others but found DHL good always as i only have used DHL always.
Q2257_C6	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? My choice is DHL
Q2257_C7	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? Although I have tried Aramex for Auto parts, I still prefer DHL or Fed Ex.  They can all deliver door-to-door.  I was not very impressed with Aramex's delivery time.
Q2257_C8	RE: Aramex vs FedEx or DHL? me and my wife would use aramex to send documents for our distance educ classes based in australia. we chose aramex over DHL because of the pricing they give. they can deliver it quickly enough, though of course dhl and fedex [or ups] are better at that. but with pricing, i'd say aramex. for documents that is. but with jewelries or gadgets, etc, im not really sure i'd chose aramex to deliver those for me.

Q2259	Does Qatar have an Ikea? Hi, i was just wondering if in qatar if there are any ikea, sears, the bay,target, stores etc... or are they just canadian/ american stores?
Q2259_C1	There's no Ikea in Doha. There's no Ikea in Doha. They've been playing with plans of opening one up for years. Closest is in Dubai. I just came from there today. They will ship your purchases to Doha, but you have to go there in person and buy the stuff. Delivery time is 5-7 days. The price is 3.7 Dirham per kg, but a minimum fee of 300 Dihram. Worth it, if you buy a lot. Supposedly there's a catch my friends told me about AFTER I got back from Dubai (I'm currently looking for new friends;)). The weight price they quote is not just regular kg's, but kg in terms of volume. In essence they said you can expect to pay twice of what they've quoted you. But, I guess I'll know the exact answer to that in 5-7 days, when my goods arrive.  If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough...
Q2259_C2	but CRAP from Ikea no,   but CRAP from equal quality is easy to find.
Q2259_C3	No there isn't any Target or No there isn't any Target or WalMart or anything like that. There are not really any American chain stores. ( Can't speak for Canadian stores as I have never been to Canada) There are a few UK department stores. We have the souqs and French grocery stores. Nothing here is like it is in America or Canada. You will have to search and search for the things you need.   Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )

Q2276	tv, internet, landline package I've looked on qtel website and there doesn't seem to be an "all in" package for tv, internet and landline. Do you have to get each seperately and add on the premium packages like show sports, abu dhabi sports etc?
Q2276_C1	When on the Qtel website When on the Qtel website looking at TV packages, it states in small print that that cost of each package includes basic 1mb and landline. Had mine installed the other week.  I think many people, including myself have to have the basic 250QR package installed then can update once installed. I expected the internet to be appalling but it actually isnt that bad! When streaming UK sites through my VPN connection, it runs smoothly and does not cut out.  I've added the sports channels now but to be fair, even if you paid top dollar for all the tv channels, the vast majority of them are pretty naff.

Q2279	Family visa for would be spouse ? My friend want to apply for family visa for his would be wife... They are getting married in June09 and bring along the family when he returns. Is it possible to get family visa like this ? Pls share your experience and knowledge.. thanks
Q2279_C1	RE: Family visa for would be spouse ? TO GET FAMILY VISA HE NEEDS TO SHOW HIS MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE AND OTHER RELATED DOC. AFTER MARRIAGE HE CAN BRING HIS WIFE ON VISIT.AFTER ENTERING SPOUSE NAME ON PASSPORT. AFTER HIS WIFE COMING FOR VISITING IF HE HAS QATAR RIYAL 7000 HE WIL GET FAMILY VISA.  AS MUCH AS I KNOW.
Q2279_C2	RE: Family visa for would be spouse ? A would-be wife cannot be considered to have a Family Visa. After marriage, only then that the Immigration will consider his would-be wife under family status upon submission of the Marriage Certificate.   Your friend must wait then.
Q2279_C3	RE: Family visa for would be spouse ? Dear Proposer,  In normal case, you friend will need to have a short wait where he completes the paperworks for his wife to join him.  Yes, there's a way if he wants his wife to come along with him.  His marriage is on June '09 (ie the custom or social marriage). But he could go for a court marriage at an earlier date, and be legally married (if not socially).  He could then submit all the necessary papers and get his wife's visa well in advance (of course, if he meets other criterion)

Q2282	Good place to learn sailing and do watersports Hi all, I would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayaking and jet sky.   Where is the best place in Doha to enrol for such activities? Any idea of the fee?
Q2282_C1	RE: Good place to learn sailing and do watersports To my understanding there is a Sailing club in the Ritz-Carlton/ Diplomatic club area. You might want to try it in there.  As per Jetskiing may be go aside to Intercon and there you can rent a jetski either for 1/2 hr or 1 hr and have some fun.  Best of luck....regards
Q2282_C2	RE: Good place to learn sailing and do watersports When I visited Doha I've been at the Sailing Club and it is really cheap compared to European costs. For about 2000 QR per year you can access to the Club and use the Lasers and 470 boats. I suppose they can offer also lessons, but with the quite wind that blow in Doha it is really easy to learn. Actually I hate the noisy and polluted jet sky, so my suggestion is lear to sail and you will never live without.  Cheers from Italy!

Q2298	Why doesn't the Government Vet pick up the phone? I have been trying for days to get a hold of the Government vet to inquire about the feral cat problem in our area.  I have heard they will capture neuter and release, if you can get ahold of them. Anyone have any luck with this??
Q2298_C1	RE: Why doesn't the Government Vet pick up the phone? Honestly - don't bother calling as they will never answer! Forget fax and email as well!   You have to go down in person to the Animal Resource Department on Airport Road and talk to someone there. They're open between 6.30am and 1.30pm Sunday - Thursday.  If it's one or two cats they will lend you traps that you can set, trap the cats and take in before 10am for neutering. They can be collected the following morning and you can re-release them into your area  If it's a large population then they will probably arange to come and trap them themselves and release them.
Q2298_C2	RE: Why doesn't the Government Vet pick up the phone? Chelsea  Thank you for that info - we also have a major cat problem on our compound and I need to get hold of them but I work (and they really won't give me time off to go to the Animal welfare place).  You don't happen to know if they are open a little later in the day?  Many thanks  J

Q2308	is "Arhaan" Muslim name? ARHAAN a muslim name? if yes: what is meaning?
Q2308_C1	RE: is "Arhaan" Muslim name? gotcha did you try searching on the net before posting??  I found this  http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_meaning_of_arhan  Regards!!
Q2308_C2	RE: is "Arhaan" Muslim name? yes, i searched on net, it is not clear , in your link its showing the meaning of Arhan  or arahan.
Q2308_C3	RE: is "Arhaan" Muslim name? To use the same source as the first answer, but with the spelling you gave   http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_meaning_of_arhaan  Means Ruler, but does not define origin, which my earlier post suggests is Aboriginal not Islamic.
Q2308_C4	RE: is "Arhaan" Muslim name? Beloved Brother/Sister, there is no such thing as a 'muslim' name; for one is recognized as a believer in the sight of Allah SWT because of his belief and deeds, not because of his name. The meaning of this name is "ruler" and it's origin is Indian. And If one wishes to name their child 'Arhaan', it would be a perfectly acceptable name in Islam. If the question was 'is it a good name?', then we would advice that there are plenty of better names one may keep for their children.

Q2310	EDITING/DELETING COMMENTS Lately I found out that author of threads can self regulate their thread.  I mean, the author can edit/delete unwanted comments as the author wish to!

As I understand it also, one can edit his/her OWN comment but never other's comment! Does this policy holds true?

Q2310_C31	I guess they didn't consider I guess they didn't consider it worthy of a response! I don't think anyone works on QL full time, so they probably only send a reply to those that really need one.
Q2310_C32	tallg, so easy to say.......... NO. It's respect to someone asking question.  Are you fun of just disregarding queries? And by saying nobody works fulltime, are you insinuating that Mods are not doing their work with a little sense of responsibility? It's just just!!!!! Lol!!!!!!

Q2310_C33	All I know chill out dude!  All I know is that QL isn't run as a business, and the owners and mods all have their own lives to lead outside of the website, so it's inevitible that some questions go unanswered and some threads/classifieds go unmoderated.   If it's that important ask them again, though personally I can't see that anything to do with QL can be THAT important.

Q2317	Authentic Indian Curry Ok... my son is over here with me at the moment. And he wants to try a real authentic Indian curry. Back home the curry houses serve British Curry, which is awesome and one of my favorite meals, but is different from that served in India (or so I am told).  So where should I take him for lunch?
Q2317_C1	I know I am bad. And yup I I know I am bad. And yup I went against the advice. But the theme of the thread still seems to be, that the curry is just as good, if not better in the UK.  And back home I live in a sleepy little city that has no Thai, no Lebanese, and no Turkish restaurants. So it's best to give him food experiences he can't get back there.

Q2318	What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as opposed to the UK)? I'm moving to Doha in September and was wondering what things aren't so great about it. Hopefully you guys won't talk me out of moving!
Q2318_C1	RE: What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as... It is ungreatfull for any body to say all this . You guys have come here not because you did not know the weather, the rules  or what ever  , the fact is all of us have come here because you earn so much more and you have high saving potential and that is the only thing that brings you here. My friend you also are moving from your home country to Doha not for any thing but the money you are offered ,and now please  understand to gain some thing you defenitely have to sacrifice some thing  and i do not know what you sacrifice , but it is all for MONEY YOU COME so just decide what you want. It is meaningless to  having such debates on this subject. i am sorry guys,  i felt like telling the REAL FACT.
Q2318_C2	RE: What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as... You will always be a slave, as this is their policy here. Buy a car? No, sponsor needed. Open a giro bank account? No, sponsor required. Bring your wife? No, sponsor required. Leave for a holiday? No, sponsor required. And so on and so on. The biggest disadvantage is that water costs twice as much as petrol. You sometimes wish you were a car.
Q2318_C3	RE: What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as... It is drinkable but not advisable.
Q2318_C4	RE: What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as... there are no random shootings or gunmen on the loose.
Q2318_C5	RE: What are the big disadvantages living in Doha (as... Too bad you are only looking at the dark side, lol.   Climate would be a disadvantage - it's really hot right now. But many expats have the ability to leave in the summer.  Climate is also an advantage - no snow and Christmas dinner outside on the patio.  I suppose that drinking water can be a problem depending on where you live.  I drink the water out of the tap all the time.  Cars - disadvantages include absolutely insane drivers although it has been getting better.  An advantage includes cheap gas and the ability to buy a better vehicle than you probably had at home.  Social life - disadvantages - you probably will remain within your ethnic group, i've found it hard to mix and mingle with the Qataris.  On the other hand, you will make excellent friends and have the time to socialize with them.  Vacation time - only an advantage here.  We have almost triple the vacation time we had at home, the money to go places, and you don't have to travel as far to go to exotic destinations.

Q2329	Internet Control Which is the best software to maintain parent control over internet use by kids. Any suggestion please?
Q2329_C1	RE: Internet Control I have a transparent proxy on Linux, with squidguard and dansguardian, but that's a complicated setup.
Q2329_C2	RE: Internet Control Really, the best way to <i>"maintain parent control over internet use by kids"</i> is to browse the web with them. This way you can tell them which site to go or not to go to. Plus, you get to spend quality time with them which they(your kids) will appreciate later on.  I can recommend using <b>OpenDNS</b> if you insist on using an automated way of restricting their web access. Just <i>Google</i> the word <i>Opendns</i>.  ...

Have been using AVG for nearly 10 years now and not a problem - very thorough in keeping those hackers and viruses OUT!  Norton in my humble opinion takes up a lot of computer memory and likes to stick it's nose in everywhere including your internet browsing! Not to mention expensive! It came free with my new desktop and I couldn't delete it quick enough! I think it does an all right job with anti-virusing but for me, AVG!!! Good luck

Q2351	Entry Visa Process Hi everyone,  I've been accepted for a role at HMC and have been told my entry visa is a 3-8 week process.  It's been almost 8 weeks now and I'm concerned it will take much longer, especially hearing some of the stories here (6 months to get a visa!)  Should I be concerned and expect the process to take much longer?
Q2351_C1	..as i was told.. ..entry visas may be finished in one day..that is, if the person doing it has no other things to do..but, visa issuance to an applicant has so many requirements..are you sure it is only the visa you're waiting for..?..have you received a job offer..?..as i previously stated, mine took only a week ( if i remember it right)..and then there was a mistake on the name printed..and then it took them less than a week to have it corrected...
Q2351_C2	I have pretty much given them I have pretty much given them everything they need. I have already been offered the job and signed the contract. I was told they are sorting out my entry visa which is a 3-8 week process, and when this is sorted they would organise my flights to come to Doha.  So I'm really not sure how it all works from here...
Q2351_C3	Individual visa shouldn't Individual visa shouldn't take as long. I think if you have already signed the contract then there is nothing to worry about. Relax, HMC is not going to cheat you. They might have applied for a bunch of visas, hence the delay.  Good luck.
Q2351_C4	Thank you for your Thank you for your responses.  It has now been over 3 months and is getting very frustrating! I am being kicked out of my current job because they can no longer afford to keep me here any longer.  3 months for an entry visa and still counting! I can only imagine what more things I have to do before they will fly me to Qatar.  Is this normal? Every story I hear, it seems the maximum one has to wait is 4 weeks for an entry visa!
Q2351_C5	which kind of visa did HMC which kind of visa did HMC applied for? is it visit? business? or working visa?

Q2361	Which GPS is good? Guys, am planning to get a new GPS for my car...had Garmin before and it was really good. I saw some stuff in Carrefour, but most of them don't even have maps for Qatar installed, just Europe! What do you recommend and is not worth buying?
Q2361_C1	Get a Garmin. Nokia's screen Get a Garmin. Nokia's screen just isn't big enough to be useful while driving <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/" title="Monotone MIA by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpg" width="240" height="97" alt="Monotone MIA" /></a>
Q2361_C2	It is.. I think you can get it in 990 QR from anywhere .... but check it should have a 4GB SD card included and 1 year warranty !!! If you want from me ... I just got it this month, I will give big discount. :) Adeel Ali
Q2361_C3	Buy Nokia 500 Get a Nokia 500, as it is cheap now with free 4GB SD card, it can play mp3 and videos. You can unlock it to install iGO, Garmin, TomTom and many others and it works great with all of them. If you unlock it, your life will be easy and you will also be able to play DivX movies on it !!!
Q2361_C4	Did you get that, Iryssa? Did you get that, Iryssa?
Q2361_C5	GPS... Samsung Omnia...is very good since it comes with a touch screen as all navigation hardware should be.....It also has 5MP camera!!!  The best thing about Mobile Phone GPS is you can install Other GPS software other than the company provided GPS  Free GPS softwares are Google Maps & Nav4All But Garmin has the best "looking" software although all the info provided are the same!!!  The free software do not provide Voice Assistance & do the Route Plan.   Free GPS software: 1. Shows where you are in real time.  2. Shows your destination. So the only thing missing is the Voice Assistance. Route planning is hardly required......unless you plan to travel into the desert alone.  Buying Garmin GPS software cost $200 .... almost a third the price of an entry level GPS Phone. Doesnt make sense to buy it when there are free software!
Q2361_C6	Jackmohan, I disagree Jackmohan, I disagree 100% The screen size on a mobile phone is just too small to be useful as a vehicle GPS where you need 100% concentration on the road without leaning forward to see which way you are going on a 1.5 inch LCD!  Yeah, probaly fine as a back up for walking once you leave your car, but for driving, buy the right tool for the job! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/" title="Monotone MIA by baldrick2dogs, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpg" width="240" height="97" alt="Monotone MIA" /></a>
Q2361_C7	Garmin I had been using all the series of Garmin. its all good with different features with each series. Gamin Nuvi is the model for Automobile Navigation.  Nuvi 200 series - 205, 205E...... Nuvi 300 Series - 350, 360...... Nuvi 500 Series Nuvi 600 Series - this has a flip antenna unlike other nuvis  Nuvi 700 Series expensive of other series with lane direction and 3D building maps (useful in Europe and US).  so the Middle East Map version 5 2008 costs 550 riyals with the garmin dealer.   Except the Nuvi 205W series all other gaming comes with either Europe or US maps pre loaded as compliment. Nuvi 205W series costs 950 riyals comes with ARABIC middle east maps as preloaded map.  I can be contacted if you want English Middle East Maps. again if you choose to buy Nuvi 205W, you dont need to buy the Middle east map additional.   All the best.
Q2361_C8	A GPS is only as good as the A GPS is only as good as the map data it has on it or that u can download.
Q2361_C9	Thank u guys! Really Thank u guys! Really appreciate ur comments. So Garmin it is! :o)  Darude, and i thought it is only English on the main forum :P  <strong>If you're looking for a problem, you're probably gonna find one.</strong>

Q2363_C4	RE: Anti-Bachelor Day its very true discrimination is rife here in Qatar and its a shame because its these very people that keep this country functioning..

Q2363_C8	RE: Anti-Bachelor Day I read in the paper a few months back that their definition of a bachelor was and i quote " a smelly poorly dressed single man" i saved the article cause i could believe it actually said that.  the best thing i would suggest is buy a small child's coat and bring it with you when they stop you say you had to run out and get your kid's, who is in the mall with their mother, coat.

I did this without question at all as long they are not the same item as long they are for personal/gift item as long they are not radio equipment such us transmitter or receiver. if as what you mentioned they are just apparels and it is from China you wont be having a problem with the custom even they are 20 items.   and Yes China does use the Aramex courier as well.

Please do not take it personal as I dnt hate or target the western citizens as ppl, but ur governments, media, etc."  They don't have an influence?

So the only way to eliminate the usage of Arabic is to get rid of the 1.5 billion muslims around the world...That thing distinguishes us from the Romans and from the Latin language....so I can say to the Romans: "In yo' face" :)
Q2382_C9	Sorry Doha Knight Arabic is not going to die as long as The Holy Quran remains , Islam is the fastest religion in the world. there is Story of Guy who wrote about Western tourist , going down into journy into depth of earth. Long story  to cut short , when the decide to go back , they want to leave a message there , as mark of them being here. So they  choose (He the writer) to write in Arabic . When the author was asked by Press , he said Because Arabic language is going to stay as long as their There is holy quran ,and it is langauge of the future.And i say ineeded it , What if All Muslims countries united , We Will be More Powerfull than America . Look to Europe , when they knew why USA is Stronger than economcly and Militray , they decied to make Union to catch with Usa, which is like different Countries united with each other.
Q2382_C10	Abdira, Did I ever say Arabic Abdira, Did I ever say Arabic was going to die? I was talking about its use in the UN Council.
Q2382_C11	Arabic will never die, its Arabic will never die, its only a temporary period where there are a lot of non-Arabs living in GCC and that is the reason for the spread of English (which is supposed to be the international language), in the future when the construction boom will end in the GCC the Arabic language will return to its outstanding position. Qatari government has made a very good steps to avoid the loss of the language so most of the legal transaction has to be in Arabic and many formal departments are dealing in Arabic only. the above is only the social part, and the religious part is greater as for every Muslim the Arabic language is necessary coz it is the language of the holy Qur'an and learning at least a few words is must for them.
Q2382_C12	MT: why u tried to learn MT: why u tried to learn Arabic although ur English is the international language and everybody wants to learn it!? 1- u think that it will be an advantage learning other language regardless whatever it is. 2- u think that Arabic is some special language and worth to learn it. 3- the circumstances around u made u learn it. 4- some other reason.
Q2382_C13	I learned it because I have I learned it because I have Arabic friends who I go to visit and their families don't know much English, so sometimes they speak and I dont understand. It is tiring for my friend to always try and translate to me.   Also, I really like the Arabic language and would like to know it just so I know what local people and other Arabic people are saying when they are either communicating to me or about me.
Q2382_C14	good 4 u MT, this is nice of good 4 u MT, this is nice of u, in fact for me working in a construction company with many Indians around me makes me feel that i should learn Hindi and i did not coz i like that language but coz i feel that i have to learn it to make my life easier. So my point is that sometimes u will be in a situation which will force u to learn a language of others and that will benefit them in the end and same is happening for Arabic in Qatar coz u should know Arabic if u want to easily get into formal dept. and that will prevent the death of the language.
Q2382_C15	True that many people who True that many people who memorize Qura'n does not totally get what they memorize however lot of the "Quran People" go into Quran studies, learn the Arabic language, and become better Arabic speakers than Arabs themselves.  You can't say Arabic is the language of Allah, but it is the language of Qura'n...also I just wanted to clarify a thing... There is no english version of the Qura'n to become more spread and popular than the Qura'n we have, since Qura'n is persevered in Arabic, while having side explanations in what ever language. It's not like the bible where it was translated to tons of languages, the content of Quran is preserved in Arabic, the explanation or say interpretation can be written in other languages.  This is done so we keep the Qura'n change-free book, and not have tens or even hundreds of "Holy-books" that contradict with each-other and each one has a meaning of itself...we avoided what happened to our fellow christians, thats why every muslim can be proud when saying there is one Holy book which is the Qura'n :)
Q2382_C16	There is a major difference. There is a major difference. Arabic is the language of many a nation and will not die out..
Q2382_C17	Qadoomy, the Qu'raan is Qadoomy, the Qu'raan is translated into many languages. English being one of them.
Q2382_C18	I have the Quran in English! I have the Quran in English!
Q2382_C19	i guess that what qadoomi is i guess that what qadoomi is trying to say is "there is no English version of Qur'an" but there is "English translation" which shows the meaning of the same, and which can vary from translator to other but the Arabic version is the base for all which can't vary or change.
Q2382_C20	! Change is the law of nature.
Q2382_C21	No , Arabic is going to No , Arabic is going to return Stronger than before , With Qatar Univeristy Offering Law and business major in Arabic, This happend this Spring , before it was all in english , except Arabic and Islamic Shaira
Q2382_C22	Where is the Arabic Where is the Arabic qatarliving?
Q2382_C23	Arabic Isn't dying. actually Arabic Isn't dying. actually if you haven't noticed, most Moroccans and algerians used french as their first language but now after  they start re-using arabic again. even here in Qatar arabic institutes are becoming more popular since non-arabic speaker are demanding it.
Q2383	Socialising concerns Hi,  I am looking forward to moving to Qatar but was wondering if the social side is good to, do people go out for beers like in the UK after work.  I am going to miss London but am taking the plunge with the missus but the social side is bothering me and I do not want to get bored?  Chet
Q2383_C1	Only hotels sell alcohol in a Only hotels sell alcohol in a bar-like atmosphere. And it's expensive. Very! And you CANNOT drive with even a sip of beer on your breath. My husband and I would always say we gotta get out more and then after struggling through the traffic at night for a social event we'd say, never again. Mandi
Q2383_C2	Relax at home after a long Relax at home after a long day's work? Swim, play tennis, walk, watch DVDs. Occasional dinners with friends, a movie at City Center. Church. Vacations to the Middle East and Asia. Write a book. Mandi

Q2383_C4	There's a kind of suburbia There's a kind of suburbia effect here... A lot of people tend to stay home or do chichi things like play tennis at the club and have hotel brunches.  You'll have to get creative. Not impossible, but it can be a stretch sometimes.
Q2383_C5	Not sure if you have moved Not sure if you have moved here yet but there is lots to do...golf club, rugby club, eating out, bars, swimming, water sports, shopping, cinema, bowling, skating. I have 3 kids and have been here since June. Ramadan and the summer have been hard but there are lots of different things to do for entertainmant-you just have to go and try everything. If you can't stand the awful driving then get a taxi as not that expensive. Who you working for?? Good luck.
Q2384	American Holiday Food Has anyone seen cornbread stuffing mix, cranberries, canned pumpkin, marshmallow cream or sugar free red gelatin in local stores?
Q2384_C1	Megamart had stuffing mix and cranberries in abundance last week.  I have heard that there is no pumpkin yet (have bought it there before)  They occasionally have marshmallow cream (can get that almost anywhere at times) and jello-almost never see the sugar free kind, but the regular is in abundance everywhere.
Q2384_C2	Pumpkin update Megamart has -dried cranberries in the produce section (but no fresh) -canned whole cranberries in the reduced-price section -canned pumpkin. I snagged the last 2 cans in the canned veggie aisle, then found a guy stocking some in the baking aisle -I also found pie crust mix. Don't see it too often. It will go fast. (I left a few for you guys) -no marshmallow cream -no stuffing mix -no SF jello
Q2384_C3	OMG I will have to rush to OMG I will have to rush to Megamart for the pie crust mix. I finally got two cans of pumpkin from a friend (Expat Sueno) after dashing all over the city and questioning everyone I know.  I saw lots of pumpkin before Canadian Thanksgiving and have been blaming all the Canucks for the canned pumpkin shortage. You better give it up, guys, before I sing "O Canada." Mandi
Q2384_C4	Anyone nice enough to send Anyone nice enough to send me a good cornbread recipe? :) Pwetty pwease.   The internet is our revenge machine
Q2384_C5	try shoprite at the airport road.
Q2384_C6	Oh please don't dwmsdavis, Oh please don't tell me there's no canned pumpkin, thought I had some but just discovered I am out, so will go hunt for it today. Can't have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie!!!!!! Stuffing mix - have never seen it here. Had to learn to make stuffing from scratch once I moved to Qatar. Cranberries- can usually find fresh ones in the supermarkets. Canned, sometimes. Marshmallow cream - again, sometimes SF gelatin - not sure  Most of these things are not found all the time. You may have to look in a few stores to find them all. If I see any of them, I'll post it here. Good luck!

Q2390_C8	It is not illegal here in qatar And its not just one guy. there are many. You need to get a license from the concerned department and you can keep one. Getting the license is not that easy!!! I know an expat staying in Al Khor who is trying hard to get the license.
Q2390_C9	Actually, Jfast_Jfurious... it is highly illegal here... The person handing out licences is thwarting decades old trade embargoes in cheetahs, an endangered specises....   Who exactly is regulating this? not this person who is handing out licences... if he was.... he'd know that every person with a cheetah in their vehicle is violating the first law of owning a wild animal... and that is putting the lives of bystanders in danger....  May he soon be dealt with accordingly...
Q2390_C10	Xena...why a child? the child Xena...why a child? the child is innocent. Why not let the cheetah maul its owner!

Q2390_C12	Cheetah If you find his details - let me know please.  Then I'll report him to the CITES office so they can confiscate the poor cheetah and get it into a proper sanctuary for wild animals.

Q2390_C15	while i was in the bus going while i was in the bus going to uni in a nice sunny day in Brighton i was reading the famous Metro newspaper and was shocked by this article,  http://www.metro.co.uk/news/802402-police-knew-john-paul-masseys-home-was-breeding-den-for-dogs  to me i would say wild animals with their teeth out are safer than any dog alive, and god bless all cheetahs and some dogs specially huskies (i like them i always do) post some pictures of your dogs and maybe i will edit my comment and add your dogs breeds :p
Q2390_C16	Bo-Jassim Right.... And you don't find removing the teeth of a wild animal just so someone can have it as a show-piece pet inhumane?
Q2390_C17	its better than keeping them its better than keeping them in cages in the zoo or i am wrong? we let someone to take care of them dont worry about that just try to feed your dogs and keep them alive. some people buy dogs and dont have money to feed them so.. close conversation.
Q2390_C18	Bo-Jassim I'm afraid I disagree.  Keeping wild animals as pets is just as cruel as keeping them in a zoo. At least in a zoo they may be kept by professionals who actually know how to keep them, be fed a proper diet and have the chance to live in social groups.  People who parade them round as pets rarely feed them the right diet, don't allow them to behave naturally and then wonder why the animal turns and attacks them.
Q2390_C19	I am still stuck on the I am still stuck on the mental image of seeing a cheetah on a leash walking through the lobby of the W.

Q2390_C21	I took down this douche's I took down this douche's license plate ages ago and tried to report it, I was told to bugger off and mind my own business unless I wanted a one way ticket out of here.  This guy is untouchable, he does have a license for the animal, and I was told (but I'm not sure if it's true) that he actually rescued the animal from a "friend" in Saudi, who was keeping it in a tiny cage, and that the animal can't stand to be kept in a cage and is "afraid" to leave it's owners side.  Sounds like horseshit to me, but hey, I was told to shut up.
Q2390_C22	Quagmire How long have you lived in Qatar now just out of interest?   Telling us to "level down if we want to earn a living" is a joke. Don't insult me by trying to tell me how to live. I've been a part of animal welfare in Qatar for years now and the "he'll get you deported" card just doesn't work anymore.   QAWS reports people for a whole number of violations all the time. Every license plate number, mobile number & photo gets delivered to the necessary authorities, whether it be someone driving around with a doped up Cheetah, a pet shop selling illegal animals or someone whose stolen a dog. If it doesn't get any further than that then at least we've tried to help the animal by bringing it to the attention of the authorities.   I'm sure he has a license. Anyone with the right family name can get one. And I'm sure he treats it as well as he thinks it should be treated. But I doubt it's enough.  Having a piece of paper doesn't mean it's morally right to own a big cat, rip it's claws out, take it's teeth out, drug it to the eyeballs and parade it round in public places like some people do. It doesn't give you permission to put the lives of hundreds of people in danger by taking your big cat to a crowded car park and getting it out to pose with. Having a license still doesn't mean they are regulated by the authorities or have their facilities checked.   There are people here with wild animals with so called "licenses" that don't take care of them. Go to any vet and ask them how many sick and dying cheetah cubs they see every year because they're not looked after.  I'm sure he is a nice guy. I just think he sees his cheetah more of a status symbol then a dangerous wild animal.
Q2390_C23	saw him once me and my friend is arguing what type of animal was that... but i think and told her it was a cheetah!!!  I find it so cooollll!!!
Q2390_C24	Chelsea With whom have you complained about the condition of the animals in the zoo?
Q2390_C25	TCOM The animals at the zoo fall under the Ministry of Environment and any complaints go straight there. We've worked with the zoo directly trying to get enrichment programs in place for the animals but they don't ever follow them.  The zoo has a tiny budget and the head vet there is a great guy who has huge ideas on how to improve everything but none of his superiors will authorise the budget to do so.   The zoo keepers have no training and are just cleaners who don't care about the animals at all. We're trying to get as many people as possible to take photos and submit them with a letter of complaint to the Ministry of Enviroment to try and get them to see how bad it is. The same goes for the pet shops and Souq Waqif as well.
Q2390_C26	Quagmire A solely chicken diet won't be good for him. Assuming he is a 40kg cheetah, he should be having around 2200 - 2500 kcal 6 days a week with supplemented vitamins and calcium. He should be getting a commercial big cat feed daily with chicken/meat added once or twice a week as well as the supplements.

I just hope you do not apply this logic in your daily life.    If you are at this stage of life, then maybe it is time to go live in a nicer place UK boy? unless if you really like it here, which would point out your severely bad lifestyle taste. You are not at the stage yet brother, wake up and stop swimming in your own piss.

Q2390_C37	Liking common sense gkramer,  Liking wild animals is not equivalent to liking cocaine. But if you really do, you should go ahead and do it..u live once buddy... Just do it where it is allowed..
Q2390_C38	Quagmire Cheetahs can be owned privately.  IF they are respected.  But they are not.  If someone wanted to own a big cat, gave it a specially designed enclosure which satisfied all of it's natural behaviours, fed it a natural diet, treated it with respect and had strict safety proceedures in place for all aspects of owning the cat and be PROPERLY regulated with all the correct licenses and documents (not just buying a license from a friend) then so be it. We don't like it but at least it's well looked after.  But having it on a collar and lead in a public place, with little respect for it's power, keeping it in a barren cage in the garden, not feeding it the right diet, de-clawing, drugging and de-fanging it - it's not on.  We are here to educate people on all aspects of animal welfare including wild and endangered animals. QAWS is a member of the Species Survival Network (SSN) which works alongside CITES to regulate endangered animals, which a cheetah is.   Leaving a cheetah locked in a LandCruiser in the underground car park of LandMark shopping mall with no A/C and no windows cracked.... That's just animal cruelty.

My issue primarily is that my second cat is VERY needy.  She was abused by her previous owner and for that reason she throws up when stressed, bites and in general is a handful.  I don't mind I love her. But I'm not sure I have time for one more cat that needy. And with her being half blind and Mimi being fond of jumping ontop of other cats and playing, I don't want to stress her out cause of the other one leaping at her all the time.

Q2398_C45	Ok so there's no physical Ok so there's no physical reason why you can not have the 3rd cat.  From what I can tell, you're indecisiveness does not come from the fact that you think 3 cats are too many, it comes from the fact that you think 3 cats may lead you to more cats, and thus the crazy cat lady syndrome.   Rest assured, that when you have 3 cats, you will really only have 3 cats. Extra cats will not magically appear no matter how much you worry you will fall into the temptation to have more cats. If you are worried now that 4 or 5 cats are beyond your limit, then I can safely say that the worry will not disperse in your sleep over night, and you will not be forced to watch your feet as they uncontrollably lead you into the cat shelter and pick out another kitty to add to your already full household. I can promise you, your thought processes will still be intact after 3 cats, and even if you want more, you will be able to weigh the consequences and decide against another one, no matter how cute the face staring at you is.

Q2401_C3	In the US you listen man,   In the US you can now schedule a visit to the Moon if you pay enough money. Can you do it in Doha?   Yes it is VERY funny what you asked. Try telling the rental company you will take their bike to the track and even the receptionist will laugh at your silly ars.  u need special insurances & proof of racing experience, and in a place like Doha, good luck having a company go an extra step for these processes! plus of course enough demand for the rental business to survive after renting for a 0.1% population of bike racers with no bikes.  good luck though, tell them in UK they do it if they object.
Q2401_C4	if there is not , I understand... this forum is for asking....I don t know what can I find there...
Q2401_C5	ok, just keep in mind that ok, just keep in mind that tracks do not open until October in here. I actually work in the field of racing, which is why i am trying to educate you, but sure if you think i am wasting your time.  Also, the best you could find here anyways is a stock with a bazzaz ECU and a B.S tune as there isn't even a proper dyno in here.  Easy on the ego/attitude buddy, i don't need to see your results because i can't care less :)

Q2407	Termination of service with bank loan remaining I work in a government organisation under ministry of defence. I had 90000 Riyal loan from QIB. I have some trouble at my work. They are planning to end my services. I want to ask if suppose they terminate me, what will the bank do in order to in order to get its payment back?
Q2407_C1	RE: Termination of service with bank loan remaining Company will transfer all your end of service and final settlement of salary to your bank a/c. and will give a notice to bank you are terminated from job. So the bank will freeze your account and transfer the proceeds to Loan settlement.
Q2407_C2	RE: Termination of service with bank loan remaining if u r not having money to pay pls tell them to take the car and close the account, or give the for sale at qatar living and if sold fopr a good price pls close the loan and give the car to the new person. if u are in doubt pls start doing now itself
Q2407_C3	RE: Termination of service with bank loan remaining But what will happen to the balance loan amount, which will be there after all money recovered by way of final settlement, freezing of a/c  Will the bank allow him to leave the country with unpaid loan???
Q2407_C4	RE: Termination of service with bank loan remaining The sponsor will not cancel the RP until receiving a bank letter stating that there are no outstanding liabilities. So if you owe money on a loan you can't leave until its is settled. Best to borrow money from friends/family to pay it off, or you might get arrested for being a loan defaulter.    There is nothing you can do to avoid paying back the money.
Q2407_C5	RE: Termination of service with bank loan remaining In Our Company There was Same Situation with One Person..He Was Terminated from His Job ...

Q2409	ruckus in corniche this friday when we went to corniche there were trails of cars waving some checkered flags and driving at crazy speeds and creating lot of problem to people by stopping the cars in between the roads and hopping in to other car. Does anyone no what all this ruckus was all about. The traffic police really had a tough time controlling all this.
Q2409_C1	for the last 28 years, i for the last 28 years, i just didn't understand what kind of celeberation way is this by creating so much trouble for other commuters & police. They will shout like animals, make loud engine noises, burn their tyres. They don't realize that may be there might be a patient behind them who needs medical attention or has somekind of pain in his ears by hearing loud voices etc. . Sadly speaking [no offense], they are QATARI youths mostly . I wonder whether they give any alms or donations in the name of ALLAH if they get any happiness or victory in their failed but at the same time very popular game FOOTBALL. . They just proof themselves as one of the most IGNORANT people on earth as they just don't care for others.  _______________________________________________________ *****///You remind me of my next girlfriend///*****
Q2409_C2	Actually there celebration Actually there celebration reminds me of biker gangs in US. And when you see them you do the exact same two things no matter where you are. 1) Ignore them, 2) Back in your mind you say.....Idiots
Q2409_C3	I like it when Qatar win the I like it when Qatar win the football, it makes me feel part of a proud country. That said, I don't live in Doha and it's a bit different to have a few people roaring round Dukhan waving flags and hooting. If I was on the Corniche at that time it would have probably been different. I have had to wait before on the fast road to Shahhania as 2 cars have blocked the road to have a chat!
Q2409_C4	It is their way of It is their way of celebrating the weekend or some even like football etc. and I absolutley don't find anything wrong with it. Usually there is a huge trail of vehicles honking and blinking musically And the timing they choose is always after 11.30 pm. So, it is certainly not a office timing. And if they encounter an ambulance they give it a way , I have observed it personally. Even once our own car was clinched among them somewhere near Mall R/A and they stayed behind us and gave us a way.   There are different ways people celebrate their weekends, some drink, dine and date. What is wrong if some people chose driving as their way to enjoy?     Everything gonna be alright!!!
Q2409_C5	they are QATARI youths yah they are Qatari so what is your problem they are celibrating they dont disturb other country so pls. live them alone they are in their own country.
Q2409_C6	I was at corniche too. My I was at corniche too. My friends waved and shouted 'Mabrook' and they waved back. Nothing in comparison to a wedding procession in India though, bands and groom on the horse and.....
Q2409_C7	wedding procession in India wedding procession in India is something with reason and has a specific route (short distance generally), but what is the reason for these???  just read someone supporting this type of 'vulgar display of wealth'...wow! what supporters!
Q2409_C8	Comm'on they are passionate Comm'on they are passionate about football. They are young with raging hormones and want to express their feelings for something they feel for. Hah !!! I would be with drums cheering for my college cricket team with a hoarse throat in my youthful days. (not that I am old...)

Q2409_C10	Mom_me...no you aren't old Mom_me...no you aren't old at all, still you have the spirit....lol!   My opinion was to critic something which obstructs civic life. Venting out enthusiasm by slowing down traffic is not at all civilsed, what do you say?
Q2409_C11	But Siddh, they normally do But Siddh, they normally do it only once a week and that too on late Friday nights is what I have observed. Is there any harm in it? The traffic moves more slowly for say 10-15 mins but come on, it is not office time.   Rather than a 'vulgar display of wealth' I feel it is their way of relaxing on a weekend. As long as they don't harm anybody I feel its o.k. They are just having a nice time.   Well, I wish to join the convoy sometime just for fun...:)   Everything gonna be alright!!!
Q2409_C12	- Shreeya - think this way:  - Relaxing on public property? Is it normal? - Disrupting traffic by stopping cars on the road, speeding etc. for relaxing. Is it sane? - You compared drink, dine & date with road rage....the difference is clear between privately celebrating or showing off publicly?  Watch this video....another kind of 'relaxing' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJupNDIKkEk  Maybe future of Qatar? lol!

Q2411	Choice of SUV We are looking at buying a SUV and are considering the following options within our budget.Our options are  1. Toyota Prado 2012  2. Mitsubishi Pajero 2012  3. Nissan Armada 2012  Please help us make an informed choice.
Q2411_C1	RE: Choice of SUV In your list, Armada would be the favorite although Prado is not too bad either. But if you want the bestest SUV of all among the Japanese models, then my view is that it is the Nissan Patrol.  On the other hand if you want to buy a good SUV but still want to be green and go easy on the environment: then buy either a Prado with 2.7 litre engine or a Toyota Fortuner with the same 2.7 litre engine. The 2.7 engine in the Fortuner is cool on fuel and the car is a reasonably sturdy 4x4 and 7 seater.
Q2411_C2	RE: Choice of SUV Armada? Isn't that in a different class to the other 2? Armada has a 5.6 V8 engine and is more suitable for a family car that only goes to the sand (beach, dunes, etc.) rarely or lightly. The Prado and Pajero both offer V6 engines with good (if not very good) off-road capabilities.  The i4 Prado is not considered good due to lack of power. Both these V6 cars are quite reliable too (I don't know enough about the Armada, though) and can carry up to 7 people with the driver. Maintenance wise, Toyota and Nissan can be difficult due to the long queue at their service stations. Otherwise, you can try your luck with non-dealership service workshops. I'm sure there are a lot of good ones out there that can work on these three models. You can head to driverarabia dot com for more info on most cars.
Q2411_C3	RE: Choice of SUV Re Choice of SUV  Prado > Pajero > Armada!   Toyota Prado 2012- the TXL scores over VX 'cos you can always get aftermarket GPS whachamacallit to spruce up your Prado TXL. Upper spec trims may be a waste of $$$.   Mitsubishi Pajero 2012- the 3.8 271 HP ranks higher over other Pajero variants and when compared against Prado & Armada, the Pajero may appear 'dated'  Nissan Armada 2012- v8 beast, gas guzzler!

Q2414_C5	RE: Best gynec and hospital? Dr. Khudsia has a private clinic on Al Waab street. She is a very good doctor..although there is a long waiting line outside her clinic even before it opens, so make sure you go early otherwise you'll have to wait for a looooong time. she does not take phone appointments, so the only option is to go to the clinic and take a number... Another excellent indian doctor is Dr. Sujatha in Al-Ahli hospital..She is south indian, maybe keralite or tamilian (i'm not sure).. you can make telephonic appointments at the hospital to see her.. she also gives her patients her mobile number in case of any questions or emergency and attends all her calls..she is really good..!

Dr.zeenat rizvi is an excellent doctor, who is most experienced than all in qatar and also world renowned doctor(worked in uk).she diagnose each cases uniquely.but getting her appointment is difficult as she is too busy.   also Dr.Hema rajeev (al rafaa clinic)is good doctor, she will deal straight forwardly & good decisions given by her.

Among the football teams whose crests carry images of the cross are Brazil, Portugal, Serbia, Barcelona and Norway, while Manchester United carries the Red Devil slogan on its team crest.  What do you think?

Q2423_C2	I have a request to the mods I have a request to the mods to delete such threads and I will flag it as offensive. I do have another request to all QLers not to post offensive subjects in this forum. I know that a real Muslim will not post anything offensive to another community and I am expecting the same from all the other communities in QL and if things are going in this way then I will say good bye to QL even if is of not something important for you all. Please abide the guidelines of the forum. If anyone is interested for a debate on something related to a community they should approach the community leaders for a debate.

Q2423_C7	Here's the full article... I asked the question as I picked it up in an article from Malaysia. Here's the link : http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/7/19/nation/6689974&sec=nation  Wanted to know what Muslims in Gulf thought of it.   BTW, gkramer, baldrick2dogs, you label me an idiot, and yet you argue with me. So what does that make you?   Don't hate the messenger, hate the message.
Q2423_C8	I didn't argue with you, I I didn't argue with you, I just labelled you an idiot ;) I am not arguing even now, I am still calling you an idiot :D
Q2423_C9	LOL now wait, do i need to order my bebsi and bobcorn??
Q2423_C10	dont understand why i dont understand why anything and everything is being related to religion.    what does a sport have to do with the religion of a player. i dont think the football will not come to the player coz he is a Muslim...   as far as clothing and signs are concerned, they have their own meaning. they just dont put a cross on the tee for namesake. u got to dig deep to know the meaning of that symbol on their tee.
Q2423_C11	Gkramer... I won't take offence, since an *ss is calling me an idiot. I guess that's what you do, when you can't contribute anything intellectual. ; )

Q2423_C14	By this standard Muslims in By this standard Muslims in Switzerland and other countries with crosses on their flags shouldn't salute the flag or wear it on their uniforms.  And what if a Muslim plays for England or Scotland--two more flags with crosses?
Q2423_C15	I think you are an idiot. I think you are an idiot. Well, you did ask!  As to Man Utd. To the best of my knowledge they have no Muslim players, so it's not really an issue is it? They were traditionally a Catholic team many years back. It was difficult for a protestant to break into the team let alone a non-christian!
Q2423_C16	Avvid Let the muslim player playing the sport decide that for himself, he's got a mind of his own and you nor me are in a position to dictate what he should or should not wear.  So stfu and go to your corner. Like the wiseman Rizks said, this thread will take an ugly turn!
Q2423_C17	Baldrick you beat me to the Baldrick you beat me to the idiot comment but ya he is asking for it.
Q2423_C18	Gk.. you jumped the gun and labelled me... Without bothering the find the details. Did I issue the instruction? No, I just asked the question to find out the opinion of Muslims in the Gulf. Did I insult the religion? Not at all.   But yet you choose to come to the defence of the religion (I hope) by labelling me an idiot. How am I an idiot? By seeking to clarify confusion and misunderstanding? From the views expressed above, it is obivious that not all Muslims share the opinion. So obiviously this is a misinterpretation of the religion. And that helps separate religion from the politics and propaganda that cloud it.   Perhaps you should jump into the gulf. Seeing as you're already jumping to conclusions.
Q2423_C19	I am very happy with the I am very happy with the world around me, I ain't jumping into any gulf ;)
Q2423_C20	Avvid Firstly, I think you're the one to blame for everyone calling you an Idiot.   Reason being is that you didn't put the source of the article, thereby making everyone think that you're asking the questions and are out for some religious bashing.
Q2423_C21	Avvid No problemo amigo, remember to quote the source... ALWAYS!!! ;-)

Q2431	Should I accept this offer I am a Project Design Engineer in HVAC from Pakistan having an experience of 4 years. I am being offered a gross salary of 8000 QR by a MEP Contracting Company.  I am still negotiating my terms @10K QR.   Need advise from the experienced lot ??  What about family visa in Qatar ? How can bring my wife to Qatar  ?  Would really appreciate some great advise.
Q2431_C1	RE: Should I accept this offer I would think 9-10K is reasonable as a basic salary for 4 years of experience. However, I do think you need to be paid additional allowances for accommodation, transport etc. Also make sure your annual flights and medical insurance are covered.  All the best.
Q2431_C2	RE: Should I accept this offer Family visa is not a problem. Once you come in and complete your residency formalities, you can process your wife's visa.
Q2431_C3	RE: Should I accept this offer Firstly I take it this is 8000 per month? If so then NO don't accept unless the contractor provides you with housing at the VERY LEAST. Rent in Doha is very expensive. The average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in doha with furniture is at least 6000 QR a month.    As for family Visa's I don't know enough to give you accurate information. But if you have Children who are at school then you would also want the contractor to pay tutition fees as school fees are expensive as well.
Q2431_C4	RE: Should I accept this offer If you get the Accomodation Allowance or Comnpany Provided accomodation and the medical coverage ,then even 8000 Qatari Riyal is also ok but 10000 Qatari Riyal will be fair enough for a person with 04 years experience only.It also depends on your family size like for a small family with a kid or no kid even you can survive in One bedroom + 01 Sitting room also which may be aorund 4000 Qatari Riyals fully furnished but for a bigger family it will be very difficult for you to stay on your own as you will need to get a bigger house. Arranging the family visa is not a big problem as long as you have salary more than 7000 Qatari Riyals.Best of Luck
Q2431_C5	RE: Should I accept this offer Thanks all of you, the package includes accommodation by the Contractor and pick and drop facility from your house to the site. The timings are from 0600-1800 and six days a week.  What are the charges for processing my wife's visa ?

But there are factors why your visa has not been released yet, e.g. the PRO is lazy, the PRO is on vacation, no visa approval yet, the position is on hold, other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. Better confirm again with your agent in the Phils. to remind the employer:)

Q2442	Real Estate agent fake? Hi,  I have been offered a 3 BHK flat for QR 4500 but the rentals should be paid in one year advance which is about QR 54000. I am not sure about this agent whether this is a fake or real? Please tell me if this is ok to go ahead with such an offer? or Is there any place where I can verify about this agent   Thanks in advance
Q2442_C1	RE: Real Estate agent fake? Bro,  My piece of advice , advance rental payment of 1 year is not practical and very risky. I highly suggest that you look somewhere else. There are a lot of flats and villas right now being offered by the owner itself and not those filthy, good for nothing, boot-licking, single cell, blood-sucking and parasitic real estate agents. Ahhh , that is much better.  Cheers,

Everyone I questioned said this is a SCAM, which is becoming more common.  A new 3 bedroom apartment for QR 4500... it was obviously too good to be true.
Q2442_C5	RE: Real Estate agent fake? Please dont risk that. My husband & i entered  a similar deal, the landlord walked in on us saying he had cancelled his contarct with the agent and was asking us to retrieve our money and deal directly with him. We had trusted that the agent was working on teh landlors asignement & had even comfirmed this with contracts signed by the two.  We are still struggling to get our money back from the agent & in the mean time the lanlord wants his pay so badly. Dont even think abt it. Pay monthly or simply give post dated cheques...  Fore warned!

If you Have permament work visa here in Qatar not any Business or visit visa, and meet the salary requirment by Labour dept Min or above = Qr.7500 then you are fully eligible to apply for your daughter visa as family visa. you need to get  1. Salary statement from you employee 2. Bank statement for 6 month of your salary account 3. your company CR / Computer Card copy 4. Your Qtel account number / Electricy number of you House. 5. your daughter brith certificate.(attest by your Embassty and then by Qatar ministry of forign affair)   You first need to apply for approval at Labour Dept once approved then submit at Immigration Dept for Visa.  these are few that i can remember also do check with Labour dept requirment and Immigration Dept for any more requirments.

You can drive at 120KMPH while coming back as the Wakra roads have Speed limit of the same and they have cameras. But hey! when you reach close to Matar/Airport the speed limit is 80KMPH, but no cameras. ;) So, you can Drive Fast like me :D  *CAUTION: Drive fast only if you are confident in your driving skills.

Q2475_C4	I used to be a working mom Hi! I used to work in a hospital and luckily they have a day care center. But i guess my kids (11 months and 4 y/o)during that time were not sold to that idea of leaving them in a daycare center. They were not able to cope up,hence they were always sick, my 4y/o son doesn't eat and became thin. My husband told me to resign since it was not ideal for my kids to stay there.I was always absent from work and my superiors began to warn me about it. I had to choose between my family and career. At present,since my children had grown, (3.5y/o and 7y/o now)my husband told me that i can go back to work,but the only problem now is,if they will still accept me,since it's been almost 3 years now from my last employment of only 5 months. I really want to go back again,but how?

Q2478_C12	How old is your child? How old is your child?  You've got 3 weeks to get your child into a better sleeping routine.  It's not easy, but it is possible.    I would suggest skipping afternoon naps and wake your child up earlier than they're used to.  They'll then start going to bed earlier in the evenings.  It may not work for the first few days, but they'll soon settle into a routine.  In fact, you'll be better off long term, this would make your life alot easier if you had every evening to yourselves.  Quality time as a couple is just as important as a family.  Hope this helps! :-)  *****If you haven't got anything nice to say, don't say anything at all*****

I would also suggest giving a bath before bed, it relaxes them and they understand after a while that after a bath I must go to bed.  I'm not an expert, far from it, but this works for me.

I m not against of ne such celebrations, but if u will think it practically, its impossible.. So just go out in a really gud hotel, have a proper supper and gift her what she likes most..
Q2478_C37	in that case Saggi, u must in that case Saggi, u must try it out ... i perfer it over Chingaari !  good choices Adeel... but i thought u dont like pasta ...

Q2490	Is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis? My mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and have undergone many treatments including ayurvedic, acupuncture and homeopathy but none gave permanent resoluations. She's 54. Can someone share, suggest or recommend any kind of treatment?
Q2490_C1	RE: Is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis? There's no permanent treatment for this, only pallative treatment to ease the pain. My 72 years old mother is taking alluperinol & pain killers such as mobic or simply muscadol.

Q2490_C4	RE: Is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis? No cure, but there are ways to minimize the symptions and lesson the damage to the joints. I see a R.A. doctor at Hamad regularly. I am so much better after having started Humira injections every two weeks. I also regularly take methotrexate (once a week). I had been on prednisone but have weaned myself off of that, thank goodness, but at the time, I really needed it. It was the first thing that ever helped me. I call it a miracle drug. Without these medications I was a basketcase. NOw I am fine. I have regular blood tests every 4 to 8 weeks to keep an eye on any problems arising from the medications. My RA was diagnosed in Nov 2008.  Good luck!!
Q2490_C5	RE: Is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis? <p>There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but many different  types of treatment can alleviate symptoms and modify the disease  process. Alleviating the current symptoms, and preventing the future destruction  of the joints with the resulting handicap if the disease is left  unchecked. RA should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication. <a href="http://www.fitnesshealthzone.com/yoga/top-10-yoga-poses-for-relieving-headaches-and-shoulder-pain/">yoga poses</a></p>

Q2496_C3	RE: About mozaic TV + The promotion probably started a day after your installation, or ended a day before.  Even if you prove it, and convince them, QTel doesn't do refunds, they'll keep it in your account for that service.
Q2496_C4	RE: About mozaic TV + Sorry guy for posting again. I am using Mozaic TV+ which was taken during the promotional period. I am paying only QR. 250/- per month. I dont think there are hidden charges for QTEL Services. It will be better you call QTEL and inform them about it. They will ask you to pay the bill completely and will give you a credit for the difference which will be adjusted in your next bill.
Q2496_C5	RE: About mozaic TV + I called q-tel they told to me if you don't have land line then will pay landline installation charge.but in the qtel site clearly specified all installation is free. i cut from site that words below.

This promotion carries up to QR1290 in savings which includes free installation and free additional channels for two consecutive months.   What you think about this?
Q2496_C6	RE: About mozaic TV + I think its mistake from qtel. talk with qtel representive. i also got mozaic and istalation for me is free. so they will definetlly adjust in next bill
Q2496_C7	RE: About mozaic TV + And also in advertisement they specified for more information call 111. then i called this number and asked about the landline installation they told to me all installation charge is free including landline also. yesturday my friend called this number, again they told like that. then why they charged landline installation charge?. if they charged installation charge then should get all fecilities like: international and mobile calls also. but i got only landline to landline only. at the application time they didin't ask for which fecilities you needed?. thatmeans this telephone include this package.125 digital TV channels Basic channels + Additional channels( 2 month free) + 512 MB speed network connection + home telephone( landline to landline).

Is it Law that a small non-govenment company has to give a Letter of No Objection if they end your contract 5 month before the contract finishes due to their not having work? Also: a) If I/we cancel our RP and leave the country without a No Objection letter, is there any restrictions on me (or our family) being allowed back into the Country on a Visitor's Visa, obtained from the airport? b) If work cancels my RP whilst we are out of the country, and we don't have a No Objection letter, can we enter the country again on a visitors visa obtained at the airport?  Is there any site to go to and check your status of RP? How would you be notified if your RP had been cancelled?
Q2501_C3	Yes, in order for your Yes, in order for your company to have opted OUT of the end-of-service gratuity it would have to be in your contract. Otherwise, it's there. Secondly, I don't know of any rules that say companies must give an NOC in such-and-such circumstances. It seems to be totally up to their discretion. Finally, if you have been on a family visa you don't need an NOC to re-enter after your RP is canceled/expired. Only the worker needs an NOC and he/she ALWAYS needs an NOC within the two year time frame. Mandi

Q2502_C1	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... HHHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMM. I think Brit is the right person to ask when it comes to KIA. LOL
Q2502_C2	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... yeah, I know where's the Ramada junction and know where's the fly over Dring so I guess Kia is somewhere close to Nissan-Renault dealer, right?
Q2502_C3	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... On the Salwa Road, where Nissan is on your left side, go straight pass the flyover, 1st roundabout take the 2nd exit (12 o'clock), you will pass the Mercedes showroom, futher down you will see a Mitsubishi showroom, 2nd roundabout, take 12 o'clock again, and maintain on your right side, take either the 2nd or 3rd junction to the right, and the KIA showroom is nearing the end of that small road.
Q2502_C4	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... go over the flyover, past the decoration R/A, continue straight after about 2 R/A you will find KIA motors on your right, if you miss it, not to worry, there is another KIA showroom after the next R/A..again on the right
Q2502_C5	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... Check the Google Map, Please. If going down Al Muntazah from City Centre, this KIA dealer is 50 meters before Al Aziziyah Round about, on your right. and this Al Aziziya Roundabout is the junction of Sports City Street and Al Muntazah.
Q2502_C6	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... just look on doha-dealerships.com
Q2502_C7	RE: Hi, can anybody advise me where I find a KIA dealer... Hi guys,  thanx for the answer, but since I am a rookie here, could you be more specific? Salwa road is a labyrinth for me at the moment, thanx again
Q2503	What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch to India? Hi.. I would like to know what is the best and cheapest (of course, safe too) to send one 32Inch LCD TV to India? is it possible to send LCD TV's along with people who are going to India as luggage?? or is it too big for that? please if you know anyone who is forwarding this kind of things .. please let me know ..  Thanks
Q2503_C1	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... 32" Sony bravia, weighs around 22Kg only with original packing.   I'm not sure the original packing will be safe enough to put as a luggage. You may use another packing over the original packing and fill with clothes to absorb any shockes during rough handling.   The weight and size is ok as luggage in passenger a flight. But not suitable for hand baggage as it's size is more than permittable for hand baggage.
Q2503_C2	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... The brand which i have is that Samsung. i got it for special price (1399) along with wall bracket. so i felt it would be cheaper to send as its on a special price :) ..
Q2503_C3	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... why r u taking it to india dude, u get the same piece for a bit more and are assured of a 3 year warranty.....and also a lot more accessories. I was in india in jan and was surprised that toys and electronics are priced almost the same...hope this helps
Q2503_C4	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... There are so many Door to Door service personnel in doha, check with them, I'm sure they will send the same safely.  if u find any, don't forget to post the details here so that others can also think of your innovative idea...
Q2503_C5	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... I can send contact (yadu) QNT Cargo 3249842    email  yadu.qntcargo@dtco-qatar.com
Q2503_C6	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... I think it will be much better to buy it in India as the price difference is reasonable and you will get service as well as warranty. If you are taking it from here to India either you have to take it with you or you have to send it by air or sea cargo. It is bulky and heavy to handle it at the airports. I think a 32" LCD TV will weigh more than 20kg. If you are sending it by cargo they will pack it for you and I think it will cost you approximately Qr. 800/- (pls check with any cargo) including freight (air) and customs duty and if you spend one third of that with the price you are paying here for the TV you will get it delivered in your house with service and warranty in India.
Q2503_C7	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... the best is by DHL  good luck
Q2503_C8	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... Buy SONY Bravia. It's the best brand in the market. Prices of LCD TV now are very cheap.   Gud luck!
Q2503_C9	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... Yes you can do that. You can have it in your luggage when you go home. nothing will happen and it will  not damage the TV. just make sure to have it tightly packed.  Don't send it by air or sea freight because they will charge you too much.  Gud luck!
Q2503_C10	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... Samsung is way better than Sony Bravia.   If you are getting it free as a gift fine, otherwise why would you buy and ship it from Qatar????. Its cheaper in india.
Q2503_C11	RE: What is the best and easy way to send LCD TV 32Inch... I think his question is not to compare the LCD TV brands.

Q2513	Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine??? Hi I would like to find somewhere that sells alcohol free wine - I don't mean sweet grape juice in a wine bottle, but proper dry (ie not sweet)fermented wine that has been de-alcoholized). Dry non alcoholic beer is available here, but I can't find non alcoholic wine - I would be really pleased if someone could help me out with some suggestions.   many thanks!
Q2513_C1	RE: Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine??? Have you been drinking too much wine.... does such wine exist and if so what is the point? That is like having a car without any wheels and an invitation to the Playboy mansion with only 10 mintues to get there...

Q2513_C3	RE: Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine??? its called sparkling grapejuice my friend...LoL
Q2513_C4	RE: Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine??? Yes such a thing exists, just like for beer - they make it as usual then use one of several processes to remove the alcohol without removing the distinctive taste.   LOL I would liken it to a car with no emissions rather than no wheels!!!   Some people, for medical, religious, driving or other reasons  (my mum for example gets drunk after a thimble-full of wine) like to enjoy the taste of wine without the alcoholic effects.   Here is a website selling it, but I want it here in Qatar!!! I would have thought that with all the rich arabs around, there would be a demand for it......
Q2513_C5	RE: Where can I buy proper alcohol free wine??? LOL most of the non alcoholic beers do indeed taste appalling, more like horlicks, however as a previously committed beer drinker and member of the Campaign for Real Ale, I can say that some alcohol free beers are acceptable. The key to it is de-alcoholising a fully fermented malt, rather than halting the fermentation early, which leaves it sweet-tasting. In doha the only one that is ok is holsten, but others exist outside doha.   still waiting for someone to point me in the right direction!

Q2515_C2	RE: How is Ford Explorer? Hi, I have an older 2003 model. It drives very well. No problems. I bought it because it's more compact than the large Toyotas. Drives more like a car. Steering & handling good. Power is good. 4.0ltr V6 is well tried & tested. This is the biggest selling SUV in America for many years. No problems at all with service & none for spare parts if you visit the Ford Service centre. I was just out there on Saturday to get a new cap for the brake master cylinder reservoir which some-how went missing. They looked it up on the computer - cost was QR10. Plus a new rubber bumper for the rear door latch was also missing - again no problem at all. Cost QR5.

Later they ended up collecting all candidates CV,s and told them -they will call them later , which provided some space in the hotel for the people staying there .

The last three should be certified, but in practice you probably don't need to. Photocopies are acceptable. You also need passport photos of yourself, your spouse and your children.

Q2528	Help!! How to stop severe hair fall I know this topic has been beaten to a pulp, so to speak. But my problem is not Male Pattern Baldness (Alopecia) which is genetic and can't be stopped, for now. I'm starting to lose much more than the normal amount of hair that falls every day. Does anyone out there know or is using some home remedy to stop hair fall? Please share. I'm worried that if it continues, it will result to something like this:
Q2528_C1	Change your shampoo. Or better yet, stop using for now.   If not, maybe the food you eat...
Q2528_C2	Azi, thanks. Do you have any Azi, thanks. Do you have any idea about foods that can cause (or may trigger) hair loss? I have also thought about that because since I came here my diet has changed from what I used to eat back home.
Q2528_C3	Go back to Micronesia for a Go back to Micronesia for a month or so and see if it makes any difference. If it does, never come back. If it doesn't, stay another month and get it treated by a good dermatologist.
Q2528_C4	there you go...must be the food too much of everything is bad.  Egg, chicken, nuts...anything oily, perhaps?
Q2528_C5	If u are eating out regularly If u are eating out regularly (I do) or otherwise and think that not much proteins are going  into your system get some protein supplements. Atleast it stopped hair fall for me (dont ask me how and why as I have no medical support to prove it.... some guy from Nutrilite spoke to me and suggested, I followed and it worked). But again you may not take my word and decide for yourself.
Q2528_C6	next time rinse your head next time rinse your head with bottle water. More better if its Evian.
Q2528_C7	Prism Thanks man. That's Prism Thanks man. That's exactly what I need. Some proven personal/home remedy. Because I have actually tried some medication before asking you guys but it didn't work. And I don't have the time to try or experiment on all the available meds out there.

Q2530	Loan Repayment Have a loan from Ahli Bank for 150000Qrs for 4 years.  Planning to clear it in one settlement. What are the procedures and will they charge me anything for this action? now the interest rate is 6% flat.
Q2530_C1	I think (when I took a loan I think (when I took a loan from HSBC) you will have to pay a high interest during the first year if you want to clear your loan.  After the first year you pay only 1% on the balance amount and get a clearance letter.  But it is always better to check with the customer service at the bank as sometimes rules change and each bank may have their own policy.  However, Qatar Central bank Set the rules, so be sure the bank is not ripping you off.
Q2530_C2	yes they do apply a penalty. yes they do apply a penalty. and i think it's 1 or 2% of the remaining amount without interest. So basically if you had to pay 100 QR (no interest included) you will end up paying 101 QR.   They apply this penalty because they are not entitled to charge you the interest anymore.   Banks... can't live with them, can't live without them...
Q2530_C3	They apply the penalty They apply the penalty because by repaying your loan early they are not making any more money off the loan (in the form of interest).
Q2530_C4	is it same for car loan also? is it same for car loan also?
Q2530_C5	1% charges .. i did the same 1% charges .. i did the same but Ahli S***ing us
Q2530_C6	It's the same for all loans It's the same for all loans
Q2530_C7	The procedure is simple but The procedure is simple but it takes some time. You will go to Ahli and tell them that you want to Repay your loan in full. They will make the paperwork and contact you.  Normally there are no taxes besides the leftover amount you have to pay back. But this is Qatar... nothing is normal when it comes to banking. So they might charge you... why don't you just give them a call and ask.

Q2541_C3	RE: Where Can I Buy the Proactiv Skin Care System in Doha? I am not sure if you will find Proactive in Qatar. Skincare is something which the consumers have a sort of loyalty. A consumer who is using Clinque, Clarins or Lancome products are not going to change to a new brand even if it is having very good products or marketing strategy. It will be difficult for a Brand like Proactive to survive in a niche skincare market like Qatar. It will be better if you can buy it on line or arrange with someone to buy it from US.
Q2541_C4	RE: Where Can I Buy the Proactiv Skin Care System in Doha? why hunting for proactive? if you are having any facial issue, just try some very simple but great results home remedies.its easy and doest cost a lot.  good luck

Q2542_C2	That game was an absolute That game was an absolute disgrace - players intent on getting each other sent off, more activity on the bench than on the field, MORONinho acting like the petulant child that he is - Spanish football at its cheating, lying, snide worst - "Great game" - common Brit, Id rather watch Accrington Stans v Port Vale!!  If thats the best thats on offer, better neither of them turn up at Wembley for the final and United just take the trophy by default. The contrast between Tueasday nights game and Wednesday nights game was stark. Its little wonder to me that the football naive fans of the Middle East are taken in by Spanish football.

As for the game itself,absolutely digraceful performance by Madrid,"Jose Mourinho- best coach in the world" my A#@...it was pathetic to see how he set up his side to DISRUPT the flow of the game because he KNEW if he went out there & played the game in the true spirit of football,it could well have been another 5-0 thrashing like Barca gave his "galacticos" @ the Camp Nou a couple of weeks back...so much for "the most expensive club in the world"!!!...just goes to show limitless funds alone does not a great team make,same story with Chelsea & Man. City,plenty of money,no vision...Football won last night amidst Madrid's anti-football,Barca still shone through...i'm a Liverpool supporter through & through but the way Barca played & won last night,i can't help but hand it to them,Messi's 2nd goal was a moment of footballing brilliance...unless there's some massive miracle,Barca is taking the European Cup this time,no question about it...

Q2543	Do Landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if leaving country? Hi my relative may be leaving Qatar shortly and wanted to know if the landlord will refund advance and post dated cheques? Is there any law pertaining to this? I had heard that they do return the money if one is leaving the country but wanted to know is thst just based on goodwill of the landlord or is there some law?
Q2543_C1	RE: Do Landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if... Renting law in Qatar states that if your RP is cancelled the landlord must refund all paid rents and return the cheques.

Watching yoo
Q2543_C3	RE: Do Landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if... As I know legally you shall pay for entire contract period and the land lord will not be in need to return your cheque. But here the land lords will be very happy when they understand you are leaving since they can give to some one for higher rent. In addition they will get rent amount for one or two months from the date of vacating.(Free rent).  If you are lucky u will get back your cheques without any deduction. But remember u r in qatar.

Q2544_C2	RE: Cruel conditions for visa ?? Because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here.  And those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation, shopping etc.  Unless you are contributing to the economy, either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist, you aren't really welcome here.   And if your parents are that age, you should be visiting them, not vice versa.

I read a post from deedee that all his parents and the in-laws above 70 years were able to visit Qatar. deedee it depends on your Nationality and I know yours.

Q2544_C8	RE: Cruel conditions for visa ?? Ah!! Come on people, the place where I am from is where a lot gulf citizens go seeking a healthcare!!! Moreover, I won't ask parents to come here if they are on a wheelchair???? Both are still healthy and very well, was John McCain 72? And a lot of political characters over 65? Are they entitled to have a visa to Qatar??   Anyway, everyone comes here to Qatar hi is very likely to spend; he will not come if he doesn't spend, and to "rami-leb" ... yeh you bet, how could I forget such a solution? I have to visit them, thx for advice and I appreciate your idea>>>  finally thx for every one has answered my q.
Q2544_C9	RE: Cruel conditions for visa ?? Well I don't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue. First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors, if you don't have a health card you'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies. Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative, or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee, instead of simply not allowing the elderly -who should be treated with more respect honestly- to enter. After all what's the median age of the parents of working residents here? 40? I don't think so. But as some people say it's their roof, their country, let them do with it what ever they want.
Q2545	What are the requirements to take a car to Saudi on visit visa (Umra) I want to go to Saudi Arabia to perform Umra and want to take my car with me.

AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ROUTES, JUST NO PROBLEM (EITHER TAKE  GPS OR YOU WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL ON THE HIGHWAY STRAIGHT.

They may ask you not to bring in flowers etc and it is really just up to you. If you have it outside of Italy then you will have to have all your documents etc sent off to the Vatican for registration and they will want to know details about your local diocese.   Congratulations and best of luck. If I can offer any advice to folks getting married is don't spend large on flowers and decorations (apart from for the brides bouquet, it will be in lots of photos) and do spend up large on the photographer as you will want quality.

Q2562_C7	Grass Fed Well, I follow Paleo diet; therefore, I am after grass fed meat which is likely impossible in Qatar. I used to in Australia where mostly cattle are grass fed. I know, they can't export their grass fed animals because they don't look healthy physically but still Aussie meat will be somewhat grass-fed.

Q2562_C11	Aussie meat at Mira VANMOST,   I found Australian Lamb at Mira that is very fatty but so nice in taste.  It is about 15 QR per Kilo.  When I read what you said about grass fed animals and how importers do not prefer it, I thought maybe that lamb is grass fed, that's why it's less in price and has more fat.  Please reply because I was looking for grass fed meat since I arrived in Qatar last year but no way the stores will tell you what kind of food animals have.  If that Mira lamb is grass fed it will be the greatest news for me, since it tastes nice and much less in price than other meats.

Q2562_C15	Vanmost, now, I do not know Vanmost, now, I do not know this for sure, but I have been told that meat from NZ is all grass fed.
Q2562_C16	And good luck doing Paleo And good luck doing Paleo here...I would not even try to accomplish that here. It's hard enough to find stuff for a normal diet.
Q2562_C17	NoMerci @Nomerci...  As I told earlier, grass fed animals don't look healthy and they got yellow fat as well. Therefore, mostly importers don't want that meat because consumers are not aware of facts.  So, every exporter has to give some grains and corn to animals even Aussie and New Zealanders also do.  But still their meat is rich in Omega 3...  I know, it will be hard to follow Paleo or maybe I have to converted it into low carb... But I will try my best :)
Q2562_C18	I find the Australian meat in I find the Australian meat in Doha tough. I buy NZ beef and lamb. Mandi

Q2581	Chaging work before the end of the 1st year is it possible to change jobs during your first year in Qatar?  The current sponsor will give release and NOC.
Q2581_C1	qatarisun ..Written Approval I suggest he/she secures a written approval or some evidence to testify his employer will release them.  Another QLer posted that after he dropped the legal case he filed against his employer, who previously agreed to release him but didn't pay his dues, they turned against him and denied the agreement.  Better be careful.  Salam
Q2581_C2	Given the situation Hi Fado   Given the situation between a certain two countries I would not if I was you. I have heard of people being asked to leave Qatar within 48 hours after asking for a transfer.  You should inquire with other people from your home country here and they can fill you in on it. Its politics again!
Q2581_C3	Not possible... You may have the NOC on hands from your current sponsor, but the Immigration will not allows you to change your sponsor, when you did not completed a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor. And working with another company not your sponsor is certainly illegal.
Q2581_C4	Apple If I'm working for 6 months to may current sponsor and i will resign with NOC (release paper from my sponsor). As per advice to my next sponsor that i will exit to point of origin and they will just send the new visa & plane ticket this is possible?
Q2581_C5	bingbong That is possible. But your visa should be cancelled by your sponsor and you need "NOC to return within the 2yrs banned period".  Note: NOC to transfer sponsor is different from NOC to return w/in 2yrs banned period.
Q2581_C6	Apple who will provide the "NOC to return within the 2 yrs banned period"? is it the sponsor or immigration. Tnx
Q2581_C7	Definitely, your current Definitely, your current sponsor. :)
Q2581_C8	Apple Did you experience this situation coz I discuss the issue of some HR-PRO the give me different answer the other one give me 95% assurance that I will not be banned but other PRO give 100% assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor. with this two different assurance one thing the are in common that I will exit to my country of origin and back here in Doha for new visa.
Q2581_C9	You will be banned for 2yrs You will be banned for 2yrs once your RP is cancelled, which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an NOC to return. Please note that your RP must be cancelled prior to exit, otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you.  Once you exit the State, and with an NOC on hands, things will be fine with you, in God's will!  But changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamped on your passport and without EXIT will not be possible for you as per Immigration Rules. You can double check with your company's PRO, though.
Q2581_C10	fado...Very Difficult Before or after a year, its difficult to grant you one, specially if your employer is Qatari.  Be careful please.   Salam
Q2581_C11	I doubt if you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year. That was the answer I was given when I tried in 2004 even though the company were prepared to give me an NOC and I had another job and sponsor lined up.
Q2581_C12	.....Apple, Dweller ..... Yes, it is possible. I have seen a guy, who changed after 8 months of his joining.  In that case,   1. THe first sponsor did give an NOC 2. The second sponsr was a strong, reputed one  In the abvoe criteria, it can be possible.
Q2581_C13	guys, no need to doubt it! I guys, no need to doubt it! I HAVE CHANGED the sponsorship within 1 year. I PERSONALLY. As the matter of fact, my RP was just "5 month old" at that time...  Apple, NOC is NOC. It means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company. You can either transfer your sponsorship right away, even within 1 year, sometimes even without leaving qatar, or you can leave Qatar, to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over. All the guy needs is NOC letter. And hey, it's better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said, he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours. But this is a different story and has nothing to do with NOC, or duration of work with the previous sponsor. Some people try to just renew  their RPs and asked to leave country. So get a NOC and good luck with your new job! <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2581_C14	QS, you are always special QS, you are always special dahlin, no doubt on that ;))  Now I have this thoughts in mind, does the Law based on some nationalities too? Because normally, like Dweller said, you cannot made it possible w/in a yr.? at least that's what we've been told.
Q2581_C15	Apple, someone asked me Apple, someone asked me once: what are the immigration/labour rules in Qatar? My answer was simple: Rule #1 (and often the only 1): "There are NO rules". What is perfectly working for one, irrespective of  ones nationality, gender, age, religion, political preferences, etc., might not working for another, irrespective of anothers nationality, gender...see above :)... Moreover, whatever worked for one person once, might not work for the same person next time (with the same name, same passport number, same nationality, same gender.. see above.. ) So, when the questing starts from "IS IT POSSIBLE...?", the answer is "EVERYTHING is possible". And that was my point, dear :) how are you anyway? Long time    <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

Q2581_C16	QS :) Oh! very well dear, tnx for asking :)  You seemingly right. It just appears to be the rules doesn't really applies to everyone. But then, allow me to add one more rules here, that is sooo common.   Rule #2 "Wasta" :P
Q2582	Civilized group? Anyone interested of setting up a civilized group? In a sense where nobody is bias or one-sided?

Q2582_C10	my vote goes to yeah me too..  my vote goes to nomercy..  to name a group 'civilized' seems offensive and discriminating..
Q2582_C11	Funny, so you mean it's Funny, so you mean it's offensive to call the 21st century "A civilized century" ?  Am I missing something? And yes I do not think people shoving and forcing their own opinions unto others is civilized, therefore we are not interested in a group that contains such people. Hard to understand ?
Q2582_C12	/-a-t-/azilana "It's how they @azilana "It's how they respond.." exactly, and that really betrays being civilized.
Q2582_C13	@Blosted, I won't call it uncivilized manner of responses It's their passion, strong belief/opinion and desire to sway the other parties to agree with them...now THAT is worth discussing.   :)
Q2582_C14	/-a-t-/azilana sometimes the @azilana sometimes the "discussing" option is not available like in many countries such as Indonesia and Iraq during Saddam's time. And some cases including Qatar, but Qatar and UAE are less strict than say Saudi Arabia.
Q2582_C15	as long as no one maligns the host county, the people their culture and beliefs...and sticks to the topic, it'll be a healthy discussion.   It was possible before...why can't it be now?  I guess the type of people who posted then and the ones currently active has different mindset. :)
Q2582_C16	What defines civilized? Seriously this question is like, let's say you Blosted I know your an athiest, and let's say me I am religious, now here is a question we talk about a topic let's say we talk about the big bang theory (not the TV Show XD), my beliefs and your beliefs are going to crash, in which it would become uncivilized, so I think thier should be like a safe word or something were to end the discussion.
Q2582_C17	/-a-t-/gmz21 I'm sorry but @gmz21 I'm sorry but you can't mess around with the big bang theory, since it's only one agreed upon theory. If you try to change some technical facts of the theory ,everyone is happy as long as you got the evidence. But theories do not depend about how you see them, they are what they are, not what we perceive them to be. Unfortunately for the conspiracy theorists lol.
Q2582_C18	I cannot make out any head or I cannot make out any head or tail of what goes on in kk show same as I couldnt make out anything about Big Boss and another  reality show back home. The two  reality shows back home mentioned were cheap, vulgar and may be thats what makes them popular. I do watch them once a while to keep myself aware of what these are all about.
Q2582_C19	Count on Me Am in for that grOup !!
Q2582_C20	Well I was just reading the Well I was just reading the previous replies. It just seems we are starting it with a big kick in the behind. @nomerci, I guess yes we should put some guidelines,I'd just hate being in the company of people who would just start throwing talks offensive to one's intellect or humanity without any specific rational reason. @britexpat I can't seem to remember shoving any information  without any evidence.
Q2582_C21	It would be more reasonable It would be more reasonable if we start a group in QL then start organizing get outs from then.
Q2582_C22	/-a-t-/Nomerci it just seems @Nomerci it just seems you have been watching too many posh movies! Civilized means being human. And being Human is summed up by not being a a c*nt

Q2582_C28	It sounds good, but whats the It sounds good, but whats the purpose?? I mean being Civilized is a quality, not a common interest to form a group.  If we really want to make a group.... lets find a common interest. A topic that inspires most of the people to participate.   Though i like your intent... I find it impractical. Best of Luck! Cheers!
Q2582_C29	@Blosted No one is argueing with with the Saddam issue we all know how bad he was, but you have to remind yourself what was the reason for the Iraq War, George W. Bush stated "Weapons of Mass Destruction", but back then most Iraqis (again the people who lived in Iraq not American Soldiers or Media), state it was safer to walk in the street at night, and now it's unsafe to walk in the morning.  Now yes Saddam did horrible things I should know I lived in Kuwait, I was born in Kuwait and I was barely 3 years when the Gulf War Invasion happened. So my parents tell me stories, and their families.  But if you think it's safer in Iraq now, your information is being biased that America did the best, thing they could.
Q2582_C30	/-a-t-/gmz21 no one is @gmz21 no one is arguing that the Americans did a blow job, they always do, but at least now women got rights and girls and boys can finally get schooling. I mean it's a start for a free society, but whatever it is I don't think being threatened 24/7 by a fascist leader makes it any safer. Maybe it was safer to walk at night because there weren't much "Freedom fighters" or much extremists active back then for the sole reason that they were afraid or collaborating with Saddam. But getting rid of them will take effort and time and it should not stop now.  @deadman123 common interest is not a problem, there is no specific interests but what we want is a enjoyable group which is very practical.
Q2582_C31	mutawa from both sides or mutawa from both sides or only one side?
Q2582_C32	/-a-t-/Xena I'm also sick of @Xena I'm also sick of people going around denying facts and trying to stuff in their own information with fallacious arguments that are in no way evidence based. Like people who think that Afghanistan or Iraq would have been better without western intervention or like Holocaust deniers ,it just seems these conspiracy theories are the result of their (unfortunately ) religious beliefs. I mean why don't these people deny the Armenian genocide? because it simply doesn't have anything to do with Jews or such. And that's the group of people I am just sick tired to debate with.
Q2582_C33	I just can't the "culture and I just  can't get the "culture and beliefs" argument through! I mean we were talking about how shoving things down one's throat is not a fancy thing to do, and when it's done you'd just call it culture or belief? Nonetheless that is certainly not a civilized thing to do.
Q2582_C34	Why don't people get back to Why don't people get back to work and do something constructive rather than argue into cyberspace???
Q2582_C35	/-a-t-/Stealth saying so just @Stealth saying so just shows your ignorance about the fascist reign of Saddam Hussein which forces you to see your family while getting executed by shooting squad and still would force you to smile and clap with a big smile.
Q2582_C36	@Blosted You know that a theory could be proven wrong by the tiniest thing why their called theory not facts, and that is false the most agreed Theory is the Pythagorean Theory which is still a theory. I never stated I don't find the big bang theory incorrect you just began attacking man, I was using it as an example.   Like if you want a civilized discussion you should try to understand both sides of the argument. Example would be the Iraq war you know what Iraqis say now, with Saddam their was safety but no freedom, but without Saddam we have freedom but no safety.  This doesn't mean that you're wrong or that stealth is wrong, you are both right. You believe now they can vote and not be scared of their government officials. While Stealth believes now there is a very high rate of crime, which wasn't around the time during Saddam's time.
Q2582_C37	maybe the iraqis had so much maybe the iraqis had so much pride in thmeselves that some western power was the one who got rid of saddam rather than themselves.   by them i mean the same people fighting the americans now who happened to be the same people cowering in their houses when saddams cronies used to pass by.  yep. that must be it. pride.  same with the afghans i think.
Q2582_C38	@Blosted Ignore what I have posted except the happy new year part, because 1. I don't feel like arguing 2. If there is any chance of being friends i'd rather not mess that up, because of some silly argument.

Q2583	opening a bank acct I have recently come to qatar on a work visa. My sponsors will not start a salary acct for me in any bank. i need to open an acct after which they will deposit my salary to the same. Can anyone tell me the procedure to start an acct and the necessary documents i may need to start an acct??? appreciate straight answers...
Q2583_C1	RE: opening a bank acct your sponsor will need to write a letter to the bank, listing the usuals, plus the amount of your salary.  Then you take this letter to the bank, along with your residence permit, fill out the forms and you should get an account.
Q2583_C2	RE: opening a bank acct You need a letter from your sponsor - they should be telling you this!!!
Q2583_C3	RE: opening a bank acct A few years ago I was on visit visa, and I was able to open up a savings account. The bank just asked for my passport and took copy of my visa stamp page. I got an ATM card but no cheque book. This was with Doha bank. Try smaller less busy branches and speak to a customer services person and discuss your options with them. However, this was a few years back,.. they might have changed those rules. Try a few banks and ask if they can open you a savings account. Good luck !

Q2595_C3	RE: Yellow sticker on my car The yellow sticker is a parking fine worth QR500 and 3 points on your licence.
Q2595_C4	RE: Yellow sticker on my car yellow sticker is a parking ticket.   There are different fines depending on what the officer thinks your offense is  The fine ranges from 300 to 6,000!  Yes, that's not a typo.  I took mine to the City center mall, bottom floor Ministry of Interior kiosk.   Gave it to the nice man, along with my license and registration.   He asked for my bank card, swiped it and I paid 300QR fine and got 3 points.   All because I parked in a dirt lot.   shame on me!

Q2595_C6	RE: Yellow sticker on my car Congratulations on accomplishing a Qrs. 500/- traffic violation... pay the due before your next istamara... and wait for 1 week for it to appear on the website...
Q2595_C7	RE: Yellow sticker on my car Sound the winning bell! You have just won a parking violation from the police! It'll cost you between 300/-QR and 500/-QR...depends on what kind of parking violation committed.  Take care of it immediately and be careful not to get anymore. It'll knock 3 points off of your driver's license and you only have 12 points on there. So now you have 9 points. If you hit 12 points, they'll revoke your license anywhere from 6 months to a year. Sucks, I know.
